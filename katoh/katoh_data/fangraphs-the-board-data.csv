"Wander Franco","TBR","SS","A+",1,1,"","70",2021,"High","18.7","5' 10""","190","S","R","2017 J2 (TBR)","Dominican Republic","Franco was identified as a top tier player in his age group as early as 12 or 13, and was seen regularly by scouts by age 14. Sometimes, precocious prospects are workout warriors or have early physical peaks, but Franco isn't either of those. He essentially hasn't failed on a baseball field in any meaningful way since puberty, with his success punctuated by a 2018 pro debut in which he outpaced the game's most recent phenom, No. 1 overall prospect Vladimir Guerrero, Jr., in just about every way, at the same level, at the same age. Franco signed for the largest bonus in the 2017 July 2nd class ($3.825 million) and was seen as the best player in the class by a good margin. There were some questions about his occasionally disinterested style of play as an amateur, but he likely already had a deal done and didn't have anything to play for in later workouts. He's literally always been the best player on any field he's been on, usually by a lot. The raw tools are accordingly loud, and match his stats: at least a plus hit tool with explosive bat speed, elite bat and body control, and an advanced sense of the zone to go along with plus raw power, plus speed, a plus arm, and a real chance to stick at shortstop. Franco is about as close as you'll see to a perfect prospect at this point, with questions only arising if you really nitpick -- the main one being that Franco isn't tall -- but he already has huge power, so it matters less that he isn't physically projectable. The Rays have indicated they will start Franco at Low-A in 2019 and, so long as he keeps performing, keep pushing him until he's challenged so he can experience adversity before he reaches the big leagues. It wouldn't surprise us to see Franco move across multiple levels, but we wouldn't expect a Juan Soto-esque pace of promotion, and a 2019 MLB debut seems incredibly unlikely, given the Rays' upper-level infield glut and the service time implications. Rays officials have likened their immediate impression of Franco, as a player and person, to Evan Longoria. Teammates respond to him, and there isn't even a whiff of the makeup concern some scouts conjured up as an amateur. Franco seems to be the sole author of his potential at this point.","OsxMtDgMaI0","sa3007033"

Toward the end of showcase season, scouts started throwing around Derek Jeter comparisons, saying that Lewis had a similar frame with chance for a 70 bat, 55 raw power, and the possibility to stick at shortstop with some work. Others saw closer to a 50 or 55 bat and a center fielder, and his draft spring was up-and-down, with scouts that charted all of his games reporting his hitting stats were not strong, though the tools were all still present. 
The Twins took him first overall and cut a below slot deal, as Lewis was seen as one of five options in a top tier of talent without a clear top prospect. Things have gone even better than expected for Lewis in pro ball, and he's hit above league average at every stop and reached High-A at age 19 while improving defensively at shortstop. Most scouts think he can stick there, which was not the case even a year ago, and one long-time scout even said Lewis is ahead of where Jeter was defensively at the same stage. We'll call it a 60 bat with 50 game power and 50 defense, but there's ceiling for more in here.","IRGoLxDpn0U","sa3004259"
"Jo Adell","LAA","RF","AAA",3,1,"&uarr;","65",2021,"High","20.6","6' 3""","215","R","R","2017 Draft Rnd 1 (LAA)","Ballard HS (KY)","Adell played across three levels last year and reached Double-A at age 19. The swing and miss issues he exhibited in high school led many to assume his development might be slow, but after a month of vaporizing Low-A pitching at Burlington, he was quickly sent to the Cal League, where he'd spend most of the year. At Inland Empire, Adell continued to perform, and the Angels pushed him to Double-A Mobile in August, where he was finally forced to deal with some adversity, and struck out 31% of the time. 
Several prospects of recent memory (Byron Buxton, Domonic Brown, and Brandon Wood to name a few) have possessed such titanic physical gifts that they essentially weren't challenged until they reached the big leagues, and some people in baseball posit that it can be psychologically taxing to deal with growing pains in that bright of a spotlight, with the hopes of a franchise and its fans on one's shoulders. Adell is that kind of physical talent. He has a rare blend of power and speed, speed that he has retained since high school even though he has added about 20 pounds. He's now a better bet to stay in center field during his prime than he was in high school, when scouts assumed he'd slow down as he added weight. His feel for going back on balls in center is pretty good and some of the arm strength that Adell (who was once into the mid-90s on the mound) suddenly lost in high school has returned. 
His breaking ball recognition and bat control will continue to be tested by upper-level pitching, and if they start to show improvement, it's not only a sign that Adell is adjusting but that he has the capacity to do so in the future. At that point, we're talking prime Andrew McCutchen and Grady Sizemore-type tools.","tpQIfgNoqIE","sa3004837"
"Forrest Whitley","HOU","RHP","AA",4,1,"&darr;","60",2019,"High","22.1","6' 7""","225","R","R","2016 Draft Rnd 1 (HOU)","Alamo Heights HS (TX)","Whitley was listed at 235 pounds on the 2015 Area Code Games roster but was tipping the scales at 260 not long before that. At that event, he was sitting in the 90-92 range with feel for locating a solid-average curveball. He looked like a mature-bodied pitchability prospect whose stuff might be done improving. During that fall and winter, though, Whitley began to reshape his physique. He dropped about 50 pounds and came out the following spring with much better stuff, his fastball creeping into the 93-95 range and touching 97. 
Whitley and his stuff have continued to improve, though he had a somewhat chaotic 2018. He missed the season's first 50 games due to a suspension for the use of an unknown stimulant, then had his season debut pushed back due to a lat strain. He finally toed the rubber at Double-A Corpus Christi in June and made five four-inning starts before he was removed in the first inning of his sixth outing and placed on the IL with an oblique strain. He missed a little over a month, then made two more starts in August before feeling lat discomfort warming up for what would have been a third. He was shut down as a precaution and sent to the Arizona Fall League to pick up innings. 
His stuff was wholly intact in Arizona, as Whitley sat 93-97 and touched 99. His apparitional changeup haunts both left and right-handed hitters, disappearing beneath barrels as it approaches the plate. Whitley's array of breaking stuff is well-designed. His power 12-6 curveball honors his Texas heritage but has been de-emphasized as an out pitch in deference to his tilting, mid-80s slider. He has the best collection of stuff in the minor leagues, and might have been in the big leagues last year if not for various setbacks. He may be on somewhat of an innings limit this year because he didn't pitch all that much in 2018, but barring that, we expect he'll help the Astros cause at some point in 2019.

His stuff was intact when he pitched, his fastball resting mostly in the 92-94 range and topping around 96 during most of his starts, though he has peaked at 98. 
He is mechanically non-traditional, something Gore is able to maintain because he's such a great athlete. As his front leg kicks up before he pedals toward the plate, so too does his glove and pitching hand, way up over his head, as if his mitt and knee are connected by an invisible wire. When Gore comes home, he drifts toward the first base side of the mound a bit, creating a unique angle on his pitches. 
And those pitches are good. Though he doesn't have great natural ability to spin the ball, Gore's over-the-top arm slot enables him to get tumble on his curveball anyway, he has very advanced changeup feel, and his slider is firm. He'll be able to locate what he wants, where he wants for as long as he retains his top-of-the-scale athleticism. He may be on a bit of an innings count this year just because he only threw 66 innings in 2018, but otherwise he's quite advanced and could move through the minors fairly quickly.

"Adley Rutschman","BAL","C","A",6,1,"","60",2020,"Med","21.7","6' 2""","216","S","R","2019 Draft Rnd 1 (BAL)","Oregon State","Rutschman began to ascend the fall after his freshman year, when he looked like one of the two most talented Oregon State players during fall practices in Corvallis. He then broke out as a sophomore, and further separated himself from the rest of the top talents with an electrifying 2018 postseason. He held the top spot, wire-to-wire, during the subsequent 12 months, which included him hitting .427/.584/.772 as a junior. It's because Rustchman is good at everything. Remarkably mobile for someone his size, he comfortably has the skills to not only stay at catcher, but excel there. He's an agile ball-blocker, he can throw, and he's a con artist pitch-framer who gets umpires booed because fans are convinced they're all strikes. On top of that, this is a switch-hitter with both power and feel for contact from both sides of the plate and an intense, earnest, vocal leader. He is arguably the best draft prospect of the last half decade, a polished, complete player with star-level physical tools.","riXzQCIbfPw","sa3011643"
"Dustin May","LAD","RHP","MLB",7,1,"","60",2020,"High","22.2","6' 6""","180","R","R","2016 Draft Rnd 3 (LAD)","Northwest HS (TX)","May's flamboyant ginger curls and Bronson Arroyo-esque leg kick are maybe the third and fourth most visually captivating aspects of his on-mound presence once you've gotten a look at his stuff. His mid-90s fastball plays up due to great extension, and further incorporation of a running two-seamer has given May's heater enough tail to miss bats in the strike zone. His vertically-breaking slider (May calls it a slider, but it has curveball shape) has one of the better spin rates in the minors and enough vertical depth to miss bats against both left and right-handed hitters. It's May's out pitch, but he also has a developing cutter and its movement is a great foil for his two-seamer. After trying several different changeup grips in 2017, it seems like May is still searching for a good cambio, but his fastball and breaking ball command should suffice against lefties for now. 
The leg kick makes May slow to home and he may be vulnerable to the stolen base because of it, which forces him to vary his cadence home in an attempt to stymie runners. Now at Double-A, what was once a prospect with mid-rotation upside has become one with mid-rotation likelihood.","xvHfqB6Fl5w","19716"
"Casey Mize","DET","RHP","AA",8,1,"","60",2019,"Med","22.5","6' 3""","208","R","R","2018 Draft Rnd 1 (DET)","Auburn","Mize was a midrange projection arm in high school and broke out on the Cape after his freshman year at Auburn. He looked like a mid-first rounder after his sophomore year and subsequent summer with collegiate Team USA, then took a giant leap forward in his draft spring, which led to Detroit taking him first overall. His command improved and he added an 87-90 mph cutter that quickly became a plus pitch, to pair with his mid-90's fastball, above average slider, and plus splitter. After pitching for Team USA the summer before the draft, Mize got a PRP injection in his pitching elbow. Some teams had concerns about his shoulder in high school, and he also missed time a sophomore at Auburn with forearm tightness. 
Mize has some violence to his delivery and isn't the prototypical projectable plus athlete you normally see at the top of the draft. There's also some anecdotal evidence suggesting heavy cutter usage leads to diminished velocity. These are all things to make you wonder how Mize projects, but right now he may be able to pitch in the big leagues, with some mentioning Aaron Nola as the type of pitcher he could become. He's already made an adjustment to his slider that has given the pitch 
more verticl depth, like a slurve, which adds a new movement wrinkle to his mix.  He doesn't really fit Detroit's timeline for contention, and may not be as good in his sixth year of control as he'll be in his second, so many have openly wondered if Mize becomes a trade chip once he succeeds in the big leagues. That's a good problem to have for a big league club in need of top shelf talent; Mize may give them that as soon as 2019. ","KTLpXoKizJU","sa3008444"

Drafted as a glove-first shortstop, he has developed throwing issues that we believe will push him to second base. His early-season onslaught at Rancho Cucamonga could have been interpreted as a Cal League mirage, but Lux continued to hit and hit for power at Double-A Tulsa after promotion and scouts have future plus grades on his raw power. 
Now much more physical and strong than he was when he was drafted, Lux is the latest Dodgers player to enjoy a beneficial swing change. His hands have become more active before they fire, and his swing has more lift now, resulting in a ground ball rate that fell from 52% in 2017 to 42% in 2018. His bat is quick enough to catch velocity up in the zone and Lux is strong enough to punish it. The changes haven't had a negative impact on his feel for contact and he remains a selective hitter, as well. We're somewhat concerned about the throwing issues but there's middle infield speed and athletic ability here, and we hope those get ironed out because if they do, Lux could be an All-Star.","UN_FiRAXe4Q","19955"
"Brendan McKay","TBR","LHP","MLB",10,2,"","60",2019,"High","23.9","6' 2""","212","L","L","2017 Draft Rnd 1 (TBR)","Louisville","McKay was a cold-weather, two-way high school prospect with average tools. As is the case with many Louisville commits, his asking price was high. He got to campus and took such an immediate step forward that he was invited to play for college Team USA after just his freshman year. His tools steadily progressed and entering his draft spring, McKay was showing effortless 65-grade raw power, and above-average raw stuff on the mound. On draft day, we think a slight majority of teams preferred McKay as a hitter (the two of us were split). But every MLB team had him as a first round talent both ways, so it seemed inevitable that he would be the rare player who would get a chance to do both in pro ball so his team could at least have time to determine which path was the right one if he couldn't do both. That open-minded approach has driven how Tampa Bay has developed McKay. In 2018, his offense was fine -- he was unlucky by advanced and TrackMan metrics -- while he really broke out as a pitcher, regularly showing all the best stuff that he had only flashed in college. McKay leaned on a low-to-mid-90s fastball and didn't have trouble navigating lineups because of his above average to plus command of the pitch. A plus-flashing curveball is his best secondary offering, but his cutter and changeup are both above-average, giving him No. 2 or 3 starter upside, and he's not a long way off from reaching it. Shohei Ohtani's usage is the only precedent for how McKay might be handled: a standout, playoff rotation-caliber starter and DH. Given how baseball is valuing first base/DH players, there appears to be much more value on the mound for McKay, but there's still a real chance he turns into something like a 110 wRC+ hitter who could make a club just on the merits of his hitting and fielding ability as a first baseman, and scouts have always raved about his makeup and work ethic. The most exciting scenario would be if Tampa Bay paired him with a two-way righty (Tanner Dodson was a high pick in 2018 that will play both ways) and pull the gambit Joe Maddon has tried before: rotating righty and lefty pitchers between the mound and a spot in the field based on the matchups. It could be an effective strategy on its own while enabling roster flexibility in other areas, and it saves matchup relievers until later in the game. Of course, nobody wants the Rays to get too cute and spoil what might just be a traditional, mid-rotation profile.","aCKSVKfZpv0","20186"
"Keibert Ruiz","LAD","C","AAA",11,3,"","60",2020,"High","21.3","6' 0""","200","S","R","2014 J2 (LAD)","Venezuela","Watching Ruiz catch is like watching video of Alan Shepard play golf on the moon. Things seem to be moving at a different pace for Keibert, especially on defense. He has a thick, unimpressive build and is a mediocre athlete, but almost all of his baseball skills are elite. He's one of the better receivers in the minors and is a better ball blocker than one would expect given his lack of athleticism, as if he has wild pitch precognition. Despite average pure arm strength, Ruiz is going to snipe a lot of would-be base-stealers because his throws are almost always right on the bag. 
The skills-over-tools coloration of Ruiz's profile continues on offense, where his hand-eye coordination and bat control make him extraordinarily hard to strike out. He struck out in just 8% of his plate appearances last year as a 19/20-year-old at Double-A Tulsa. Because Ruiz can make contact with just about anything, he tries to, and his lack of selectivity will likely limit his big league power output and perhaps his ability to reach base. But he has a very rare skillset for a catcher and a good chance to be an All-Star.","jGl4H285JjI","sa872528"

He crushed Hi-A, hitting .298/.386/.494 and forcing a promotion to Double-A at age 20. Kieboom didn't hit well during his two-month stay in Harrisburg and he didn't look very good at shortstop in the Fall League, but he has performed much better than expected for a hitter who is the age of a college sophomore. He is going to stay on the infield, and has big, playable raw power, and we're unconcerned about his late-season struggles. Kieboom's hands work in a tight, explosive circle, which generates all-fields thump and enables Kieboom to catch up to premium velocity. He's a little heavy-footed on defense but his arm plays on the left side of the infield and his mediocre range might be able to be hidden by modern defensive positioning. This is a complete player with a chance to hit in the middle of the order and also stay at shortstop, if not second or third base. That's a potential All-Star.","_-90cLZAZz4","19958"

The industry's six-week look at Pache during the Arizona Fall League further cemented the belief that Pache has a great chance to be one of the, if not the, best defensive center fielders in baseball as soon as he arrives in Atlanta. He's a plus to plus-plus runner with a great first step, and he has a knack for contorting his body in ways that enable him to make spectacular catches on flyballs that would otherwise fall in for tough-luck hits. He also has a 70-grade arm when he sets and throws properly, though at times he sacrifices velocity and accuracy in order to get rid of the ball more quickly, which isn't always the right decision. Pache also has good bat-to-ball skills and solid average raw power, but the quality of his at-bats and his hitting mechanics both vary. His upside is enormous if everything comes together, and Pache just turned 20 years old, but there's risk that the bat plays down because of Pache's approach. If that's the case, he might exist in the Hamilton/Pillar area of WAR production, but even a one-dimensional offensive profile likely results in star level production and because Pache is still just the age of a college sophomore, we anticipate growth in this area.","ALCsGpZ1oiA","sa916722"

The younger Hayes was identified as a potential early-round pick pretty early in high school and eventually climbed to the back of the first round after a strong senior spring. He was drafted 32nd overall and signed for $1.8 million rather than head to Tennesse, where he and Nick Senzel would have played together for a year. Hayes has moved through the minors quickly and had a strong 2018 season at Double-A Altoona -- .293/.375/.444 with an 11% BB%, 16.5% K%, 31 2Bs, 12 SB -- in what would have been his draft year. He's one of the best defensive third basemen in the minors and has progressed to become an above-average hitter, as well. A flat-planed swing and conservative hitting footwork are stifling the in-game power production. For Hayes, that's fine. He does everything else. 
It's possible the Pirates will try to coax more power of out him by tweaking either his footwork or by moving his hands, the latter of which feels riskier. Even without further offensive evolution, Hayes projects as an all-fields, league-average offensive threat with plus-plus defense.","o76lKnW1nX0","sa874730"

Now he's fluent in multiple languages and has grown so much as an athlete and ballplayer that we think he'd be in the conversation for the 2019 draft's first pick were he a college player. If you're willing to look beyond Brujan's diminutive stature, he leaves nothing to be desired. He is an elite athlete with acute baseball instincts, a dynamic up-the-middle defensive profile, and mature feel for the strike zone. He has always been physical enough to make quality contact and fast enough to make an impact on the bases, but really began driving the ball in 2018 as his frame started to physically mature. He slashed .313/.395/.427 at Low-A before an August promotion to Hi-A, where he slugged a shocking .582.

He had mostly solid average tools and good feel through the middle of his prep career. Then in his senior year, the arm strength, raw power, and bat speed all became plus, and he was the odds on favorite to go first overall. But Dansby Swanson, Alex Bregman, Andrew Benintendi, and fellow Florida prep hitter Kyle Tucker all took steps forward in the spring, and the Rockies were able to get Rodgers third overall. 
In pro ball, Rodgers has benefitted form the Rockies' affiliates being extreme hitters' environments, which has mostly obscured in the surface stats the fact that Rodgers pitch selection is below average. It improved a bit in his second taste of Double-A in 2018, then became an issue again in his late-season promotion to Triple-A. He's fringy at shortstop and as a runner, so most scouts see him sliding over to second base long-term, but he's good enough to play shortstop everyday if a club doesn't have better options and focuses on shifting and positioning around him. There's enough here that it's likely Rodgers is a solid everyday player of some sort in 2020, but he may not be the star that some have anticipated.","8R3NqST3CPs","17907"

He made the leap between his sophomore and junior years, growing into his athleticism and developing plus raw power along with above average defensive tools and arm strength. The defensive tools are especially rare for a catcher of Bart's size, as it's much easier for a more compact-framed player to excel behind the plate. Bart has the rare ability to slow the game down defensively and scouts rave about his makeup, game calling, and game preparation. 
At the plate, Bart has big power and gets to it pretty often in games, particularly to his pull side, where he hit a majestic shot that was never found over the facade of the football complex in left field at Georgia Tech's stadium. But while he is exceptional behind the plate, Bart doesn't have the same ability to slow the game at it, however, with elevated strikeout rates in his draft year and just okay pitch selection. The bat speed is good and he doesn't have trouble against velocity, and some scouts point to his solid pro debut as evidence that Bart was just frustrated by being pitched around and developed some bad habits in college. Since literally everything else you could want except for contact is already present, most assume that Bart will figure out a way to get to a 40 to 50 bat with above average game power and above average defense, even if it's on the job in the big leagues in 2020. He broke his hand early in 2019 and will miss several weeks. He's a strong Arizona Fall League possibility.","Cozg_YSvag0","sa3007786"

His signing with Chicago marked the end of a more lucrative era for young international players who are now subject to more tight-fisted rules capping bonus amounts. Despite a limited market due to the timing of his deal, Robert signed for $26 million thanks to his all-world physical gifts. The raw power and top-end speed were obvious in workouts, but unless teams scouted him in Series Nacional or during the Cuban National team's annual CanAm League tour, little was known about his ability to hit big league-quality pitching, or what his instincts were like in center field. 
Because his thumb cost him April, May, and July (he re-aggravated it), it was hard to get extended looks during 2018 until Robert's six-week stint in the Arizona Fall League (which was also interrupted by a hamstring issue). LouBob's AFL stats were fine, but his swing path left him vulnerable to velocity on the inner half, and he too often expanded the zone. There's doubt that he'll get to all of his raw power in games, both due to the swing path and lack of plate discipline, but it isn't as if he's had time to make proper adjustments yet, and the pitching he saw in Arizona was the best he's seen in his life. The ceiling is the same as it was purported to be before he signed: power, speed, offensive performance similar to Carlos Gomez's best years. There's just more risk that Robert doesn't get there.","yolHGuJGfEk","sa3003396"

Puk was soft-bodied and relatively unathletic as an amateur, but he arrived to Mesa in good shape and his landing leg was more stable throughout his delivery, leading to superior command than he had had at Florida. Additionally, Puk dusted off his high school curveball and reintroduced it to his repertoire. His feel for it returned very quickly, and it was comfortably average near the end of spring and gave him a fresh way of starting off at-bats the second and third time through a lineup. His changeup was also better than it had been in college, and looked like a potential plus pitch.

His velocity was down and the Tigers shelled him in his final start, and an MRI revealed Kopech would need Tommy John. The timing was particularly cruel, not just because things had started to click, but also because late-season TJs usually cost the pitcher all of the next year; Kopech isn't expected to be back until 2020. 
His stuff is great, headlined by a mid-90s fastball that often crests 100 mph. The command inroads Kopech made late in 2018 are especially important for his ability to deal with lefties, because his changeup feel is not very good. He'll need to mix his two breaking balls together to deal with them, and his slider feel is way ahead of the curveball. So long as Kopech's stuff returns, he has No. 3 starter ceiling if the command comes with it, and high-leverage relief ability if the latter does not.","JXUYoulUEo8","17282"

After that rough first start, his stuff and command were as they usually are. He was generating upper-90s velocity with ease, his breaking balls were crisp, and his changeups were well-located and moving. He walked just seven hitters in his final seven starts of the year before succumbing to elbow inflammation, which ended his regular season in early-June. Sanchez rehabbed in Florida in anticipation of an Arizona Fall League assignment and threw some tune up innings early during the 2018 fall instructional league, his stuff intact and ready for Arizona. Then he awoke one morning with soreness in his collarbone. After an MRI it was determined that Sixto would have to shut things down for a bit and head to Arizona quite late, so he was just shelved for the year. Sanchez has now missed time to injury in two consecutive seasons. In each year, he has often been given extended rest between starts and dealt with issues in his neck and collarbone area. That isn't ideal and all else being equal, we'd rather have a pitching prospect without this kind of injury history. But all else isn't equal when one lines up Sixto's stuff and command, both of which are very advanced for a conversion arm so new to pitching, against the stuff and command of other minor league pitchers. This is one of the most talented pitching prospects on Earth, one with top of the rotation potential. He's still only 20 so the fact that injuries have diluted his innings output isn't a huge issue yet. Hopefully he has a healthy, robust 2019 and gets back on track to debut in 2020.","OFHkPmNCPOI","sa873550"

His fastball was only in the 88-92 range at Area Codes, though his changeup and curveball were each above-average. He did not throw during the fall and instead devoted more time to working out. The following spring, with a new physique, Luzardo's stuff was way up across the board, his fastball now sitting comfortably in the mid-90s, touching 97. Four starts into his senior season, Luzardo tore his UCL and need Tommy John. 
After most of the first three rounds of the 2016 draft had come and gone it seemed as though Luzardo might end up at the University of Miami. Four outings (including the one during which he broke) was not enough time for many teams to have high-level decision makers in to see him and take him early, but the Nationals (who have a history of drafting pitchers who have fallen due to injury) called his name and signed him for $1.4 million, a bonus equivalent to an early second rounder. Luzardo rehabbed as a National and continued to strengthen his body. When he returned the following summer, his stuff had completely returned. He made just three starts for the GCL Nats before he was traded to Oakland as part of the Sean Doolittle/Ryan Madson deal. 
He has quickly climbed Oakland's minor league ladder and reached Triple-A at age 20 in 2018. Those crafty pitchability traits from high school are still extant. Luzardo will vary the shape of his breaking ball -- he can throw it for strikes to get ahead of hitters, he back foot it to righties -- and he uses his changeup against lefties and righties. His delivery is a bit violent but it doesn't inhibit his command, and Luzardo's musculature seems better able to deal with the effort than it was when he was in high school. His fastball, which has been up to 97 in his big league appearances this spring, may not play like a mid-90s heater because he is undersized and a short-strider, but he locates it well enough to avoid getting hurt. 
He has mid-rotation upside and is abnormally polished. We may see him in Oakland this year.","XPMeIpPKW2k","19959"

He has relatively advanced feel to hit for a teenage switch-hitter, his timing is fine, and he hasn't exhibited any confidence-altering, contact-related red flags, like lever length or poor plate discipline. He may outgrow shortstop but if he does, it means big power on a plus-gloved third baseman. We were surprised by Mauricio's GCL assignment, and then surprised further by both his admirable statistical performance there and his late-season promotion to Kingsport.

For two long weekends in Arizona he did everything. He crushed balls in all parts of the strike zone, ran plus-plus times to first base, and made several highlight reel defensive plays at second base. The wrist fracture kept him out for the rest of February, all of March, and most of April. When he returned, Madrigal kept hitting, but not for power, which is consistent with what plagues hitters for several months after they've had a break in the hand/wrist area. 
That trend continued through his first pro summer, which was interrupted by a hamstring issue, as Madrigal struggled to pull and/or lift the ball at all. He had a downward, slashing swing instead of the dynamic and athletic cut he'd had early in the year, when he could scoop and lift stuff at the bottom of the zone. But he kept making contact. It was a month before a pro pitcher was able to strike Madrigal, who only K'd in 3% of his pro plate appearances last year, out. 
It's fair to make a distinction between prospects who are small, and ones who are just short. Jose Altuve is short, but is built like a little tank. Madrigal is small, a diminutive 5-foot-7, 165 pounds, and this, combined with his total lack of post-draft power, has the pro side of scouting very concerned. He looked tired and sluggish during instructional league, though it wasn't as if he'd played a whole year and was an obvious candidate to be run down, furthering concerns that his size will be an issue. We're inclined to believe there's a substantial bounce-back on the horizon. He was the best draft-eligible hitter we saw last year, a complete player with few, if any, flaws.","tQxQekapA8k","sa3008139"

He's added a full ten ticks to his fastball over the last two and a half years, and now is not only one of the best on-mound athletes in the minors, but a hard worker and team leader with infectious charisma. Patiño's velocity came as he got in the weight room and added about 25 pounds. He was so dominant during his first few pro starts in the DSL that the Padres quickly pushed him stateside for the remainder of 2017, then to the Midwest League at age 18 the following year. 
Not only does Patiño have premium arm strength, but he has natural feel for spin, and is a curious learner who quickly actualizes instruction on the mound. He has already begun to vary the cadence of his delivery to mess with hitters' timing, and has mapped aspects of MacKenzie Gore's delivery to his own, just to see if it works for him. He's still a little too confident with his breaking ball in the zone, but it's hard not to expect an athlete with work habits like these (Patiño has already learned and is fluent in English) to get better at everything. You can go nuts projecting on his secondaries and command the same way scouts did with Hunter Greene when he was in high school, and Patiño's breaking stuff is further along than Greene's was at the same age. He likely won't grow into more velo because the frame for that isn't here, but he's already got plenty of heat. Conservatively, Patiño has mid-rotation upside, but how the changeup and breaking ball command develop matter because that's where there's room for significant growth.","k11tj7Ee2qs","sa3002792"

Trammell also put on a shocking display during BP at the Futures Game and hit two absolute seeds during the game. He never did anything remotely like that in the Fall League (nor, frankly, did any of the other prospects who played in D.C. and then later in Arizona) and actually struggled to turn on balls there, but there's a chance of huge, if dormant, in-game power here, too. Though Trammell runs well enough to play center field (by a lot), his arm strength still might limit him to left field. That's where we have him projected, where we think he'll be a Carl Crawford or Brett Gardner type of defender.

He has a one-note approach that mostly consists of him trying to ambush first-pitch fastballs. He'll take some ugly swings when he's cheating on a heater and instead gets something offspeed, though he has the bat control to put these balls in play if they're near the zone. His strikeout rate (29% for his career) in undoubtedly a red flag, but because Chisholm is such a clean fit at shortstop (plus range, actions, and arm), he has some wiggle room on the offensive side, and shortstops with this kind of pop don't exactly grow on trees.

Those aspects of his defense have vastly improved, and he's now an average defender with a chance to be above, and his arm douses opposing baserunners. 
Murphy also has plus raw power, though he hasn't typically hit for it in games for various reasons. In college, a broken hamate likely masked his power and was part of the reason he fell to the 2016 draft's third round. In pro ball, his swing has been very compact, relying on Murphy's raw strength rather than efficient biomechanical movement to deliver extra-bases. He broke his other hamate last year. Murphy's nearly .500 SLG at Double-A Midland is above what we expect moving forward, and instead think Murphy will be a high-contact bat with doubles power, which would be an above-average regular behind the plate.","tVv3ORj53mQ","19352"

Early in pro ball, Manning had some real trouble with strike-throwing, then slowly settled in. He has two easy plus pitches in his fastball and curveball, but his changeup is almost always below average, and his command comes and goes. His fastball plays up due to his excellent extension, but he gets so much extension that he overstrides and it reduces the amount of feel he has, both in his changeup and command.

Despite his ectomorphic build, lever length, and physical immaturtiy, Cruz has performed and has handled aggressive assignments pretty well. The Dodgers sent him to Low-A Great Lakes when he was 18, where he ran into 20 extra-base hits in 90 games before being traded to Pittsburgh at the deadline for Tony Watson. He hit .286/.343/.488 in 2018 while repeating Low-A. 
There's real risk Cruz maxes out as a 40 bat, but as long as he's getting to most of that power, he'll likely profile just about anywhere on the defensive spectrum. So, where exactly on the defensive spectrum will that be? Shortstops this big don't exist, but there's some sentiment in the industry that Cruz will be able to stay there, especially as we enter the era of the lead-footed shortstop. Others consider Cruz's speed viable in center field long term. Those who think he'll thicken significantly have him projected to either right field or third base, and others think his size would make for a wonderful target at first. One source thinks Cruz should just be pitching, due to his arm strength and athleticism. Clearly this is one of the more bizarre prospects in baseball with countless possible career outcomes.

He popped up seemingly out of nowhere as a sophomore at a lesser Florida junior college but quickly entered the first round discussion when JuCo ball kicked off in January of 2017. As the draft approached, Pearson was showing better secondary stuff in games and bumping 100 mph in bullpen sessions for scouts. He forced his way up draft boards even though teams had little history with him, and some were skeptical of the new velocity or concerned it would lead to injury. 
Pearson made seven short but dominant appearances in the Northwest League during the summer and was poised to begin 2018 at Hi-A Dunedin (an aggressive assignment), but he suffered an intercostal strain and began the season on the DL. In his final extended spring rehab start, he was sitting 94-96 and touching 98 with the fastball. He finally toed a Florida State League rubber that week and lasted 1.2 innings before a comebacker struck his wrist and forearm and fractured his ulna. The injury ended his regular season after just five outs. 
After rest and some rehab during instructs, Pearson went to Arizona for the Fall League. His stuff was electric there, his fastball always sitting 95-99 and cresting 100 mph often. He threw a 104 mph fastball and a 95 mph slider during the Fall Stars game, and he was able to dump his upper-70s curveball in for strikes throughout his six-week tenure, though he threw no changeups. Pearson was also horribly wild at times. It's fair to conclude that rust was to blame for his occasional wildness but because the pro side of the industry has seen so little of Pearson, it's impossible to know for sure. 
There's a strong possibility that he just ends up in the bullpen, but if he does and he breathes one-inning fire like he did during Fall Stars, he basically has Aroldis Chapman's stuff (though perhaps not the same extension or approach angle). Provided he stays healthy, Pearson's future is bright, albeit unclear. He's likely to be handled with care for a while in order to keep him healthy and manage his workload after what was essentially a lost 2018, but given the wide variance and top shelf stuff, there is still frontline starter potential.","t_D8-uewjYw","sa3005097"

Luciano has explosive hands and a natural uppercut swing. He hits many more balls out during BP than is typical for a hitter this age, and has taken his peers deep in games, too. 
Luciano's feet and actions are workable on the infield but he struggles with throwing velocity and accuracy when he's forced to throw from a lower arm slot, as shortstops often are. If he can't correct that, he'll need to move to the outfield. If he can, this is a shortstop with 80 bat speed. Luciano is a potential superstar.

During the spring, Bohm steadily worked his way up from the late first round to the third overall pick by hitting more than scouts expected a long-limbed power threat to hit. Bohm pulls this off by keeping his arms tucked in during his swing and having a flatter plane; as a result he's both quicker into the zone and in the zone longer than most power hitters. Ideally, hitters with Bohm's plus-plus power have more loft in their swing plane and extend their arms to generate the most power, with Kris Bryant an example of a hitter with a similar frame and this more power-focused approach. We're projecting Bohm as a 50 bat with 60 game power and split the difference a bit--he could go even more extreme for power at the expense of contact--but there are a number of ways this offensive skillset could turn out, particularly with new and more progressive hitting instruction this year for the Phillies. Bohm's defense also could go a few different ways, depending how much weight he adds to his lean frame and how his lateral quickness ages. Defensively, Bohm looks major league average at times and clearly below average at others, but he'll get plenty of chances to make things work at third base.","GOKNy9Trues","sa3007284"

It also meant Valera became an international prospect rather than an American high school draftee, and when he was eligible, he signed with Cleveland for $1.3 million. 
He is polished for his age, not only in the batter's box but in center field, where he's very comfortable going back on balls. His frame is not especially projectable but Valera's swing has natural lift and he has good feel for contact. He's likely to get to whatever raw power he ends up growing into as he matures, and he may stay in center field for a while.

He is an old, reflective soul with an adolescent's enthusiasm for baseball in the body of a Division I tight end. Because Rodriguez spent his 2018 summer in the DSL (which isn't heavily scouted) and Seattle eschews game action during instructional league, if people in baseball wanted a look at Rodriguez they sought out the highlight clips he would upload to his Instagram account. He hit .315/.404/.525 in the DSL, so there were plenty of those. His feed is also full of group photos with other young prospects and several big leaguers, all of whom Rodriguez is taller than. 
The convergence of his physical, technical, and seeming emotional maturity have caused Seattle to publicly consider skipping Rodriguez over the AZL and Northwest League in favor of sending him right to their new Low-A affiliate in Charleston, West Virginia as a young 18-year-old. The cultural assimilation curve may be steep, but Rodriguez is talented enough to have on-field success there. His approach is quiet and would appear contact-oriented if not for his prodigious natural strength, which turns would-be flare singles into gap doubles, and causes mis-hit flyouts to threaten the warning track. He could end up with a plus bat and plus power, plenty to profile in an outfield corner, hit in the middle of a good order, and perhaps be a perennial All-Star. The Kelenic/Rodriguez duo is refined enough that they each might be promoted at a pace that more closely mimics college players than recently-acquired teenagers, which would enable them to have more big league overlap with the crop of twenty-somethings the org acquired in the Paxton/Diaz deals.","fm1zz74sRbc","sa3005720"

It's possible the two didn't pair well together and that a better changeup, or a third pitch, will be needed in order to miss bats. Keller's changeup did improve throughout 2018, but he walked more guys; we think that aspect of his profile will bounce back once development isn't coloring his pitch usage.

Some clubs think he'll move to right field, and the contact issues Jones has had due to his lever length are problematic if he doesn't stay at third.
We're intrigued by the three-true outcomes possibilities here, as Jones already has huge power and might grow into more, and he's also had some of the higher walk rates in all of the minor leagues. Opposing pitchers are going to have to be careful with him or risk paying a 400 foot price, so we expect his on base ability to hold water at the upper levels.

As awestruck as his swing leaves onlookers, it is imperfect and causes him to drive the ball into the ground about 50% of the time. He hits it so hard that it hasn't mattered yet, and it may not be prudent to tweak Sanchez's swing so long as he keeps performing, but the ceiling on his power output is huge if his bat path gets dialed in. This is a pretty traditional right field profile, instability and all, and Sanchez has a chance to hit at the heart of a big league lineup.

Kirilloff went in the middle of the first round in 2016, and missed time immediately after playing his first 55 pro games with Tommy John surgery. 
He came back for his first full season in 2018 and dominated both Low-A and High-A, hitting over .330 at both stops with 20 homers on the season and strikeout rates below league average. There's some chance he is even more than just a 60 hitter with 55 or 60 power, which is what most scouts are projecting right now, with something like a 15-20% chance that Kirilloff turns into the next Joey Votto. There's some disagreement about whether his 2018 season was him dominating pitching that didn't challenge him, or if he has an approach that's a little too aggressive and he just got away with it in 2018. Kirilloff is a fringy runner who's an average defender in right field and has a plus arm, but he may bulk up and move to first base down the line, which would likely come with more power as well.","l3xPPnRQA7o","sa917929"

Hoerner makes routine plays at short and so long as scouts are okay with his funkny throwing motion, he has a chance to stay there. There are scouts who have him projected to second base or to center field. Hoerner's previous swing enabled a bit of a jailbreak out of the batter's box, exaggerating his home-to-first speed.

He had become more physical and changed his swing to incorporate his added strength, lifting the ball and evolving from a gap-to-gap speed player into a potential monster with plus raw power, arm strength and speed. 
Swaggerty didn't put up the gaudy numbers you'd expect for a guy with top level tools in a mid-major conference who had also hit with wood on the Cape, and it was because his new swing would get out of whack. His weight transfer was too aggressive at times, causing him to lose balance and be in a poor position to hit offspeed stuff.

Scouts saw early in the spring that his tools had improved and the performance along with them, but it wasn't until mid-way through the season that he seemed like a sure first round pick. He eventually looked like a consensus top 10 pick in the weeks leading up to the draft because the first round had so few college bats. India has 55 raw power (60 for some scouts) and is a 55 defender with a 55 arm at third base. He played some shortstop at Florida and could be a limited-range fill-in there, with a chance to fit at second base if needed for longer stretches.

He's hitting lasers to all fields now, adept at peppering the right center field gap. 
Built like, and as fast as, a bowling ball SEC running back, Ramos is going to stay in center field for a while but most scouts think he'll eventually move to a corner.

While we anticipate a rebound -- and Gilbert has been 94-97 in bullpens and simulated environments this spring -- college starters often experience a slight downturn in velo because they're being asked to go every fifth day for five months instead of once a week for three and a half. While there's a wide array of potential outcomes for Gilbert's fastball, his command, breaking ball quality, prototypical frame, and mechanical consistency have been stable.

He moved to the rotation in March and crosscheckers started showing up to see him much later than is typical for a first look at a second round talent. In 2018, his first full season as a member of the rotation, Howard thrived and late in the year his stuff took off. After two dominant months to close his regular season, Howard threw a no hitter in the Sally League playoffs. During that stretch, he was sitting 94-98 for much of his starts and flashing three good secondary pitches, the best of which is a disappearing, low-80s changeup. Howard can also freeze hitters with a mid-70s curveball and use it to get ahead, and his mid-80s slider has enough length to miss bats away from righties. Though he has below average fastball command, Howard's ability to throw his breaking balls for strikes significantly improves his chances of starting. His inning count in 2018 (112) was about the same as it was if you combine his college and pro workload from 2017, and it's fair to assume that even if Philly wants to him to throw more innings, an innings cap might impede a 2019 debut, even if Howard's stuff is ready.

The Cubs refused and have been rewarded, as the offensive potential promised by Amaya's graceful swing and burgeoning physicality began to actualize in 2018. Amaya's hands have life, and work in a tight little loop as he accelerates them to swing. He can pull and lift balls in various parts of the zone with regularity, and the impact of his contact is only limited by his average bat speed. The physical grind of catching is likely to dilute his in-game offensive production a little bit, but unless the beating he takes back there starts to take away from his defensive abilities (which sometimes happens to young catchers), Amaya is a pretty good bet to have some kind of big league career, and, if the bat maxes out, he'll be an above-average regular. He turns 20 in March and will likely head to Hi-A next year. How his advanced defensive ability and less-advanced bat develop could affect how quickly the Cubs push him: slowly if they want to wait for the latter or, depending on how much he hits early as a big leaguer, quickly if they don’t.","","sa917354"

He was a slightly-built, shorter righty with a knockout fastball/curveball combination, who was moved very quickly as Garcia saw 2017 action in the DSL, GCL, and Appy league levels at age 18. We were eager to see if he could continue to perform like that in full-season ball as a 19-year-old and boy, did he. Garcia had an xFIP under 3.00 at each of his three stops last year: eight Low-A starts, five in Hi-A (one of which is the linked video), and one in Double-A. Garcia's changeup and command both ended up playing better than we expected, with his changeup regularly flashing average to above -- confirming he has starter's stuff -- and his command sufficient to deal with A-ball hitters. The concerns about his durability tied to his stature are still there. He's 5-foot-10 and anywhere from 163 to 175 pounds. He threw 74.0 innings last year and even scouts who love Garcia concede he may not be a 170 to 200-inning type of arm. Instead, he may be in the Rich Hill or Lance McCullers mold, where you'll get 125 - 135 innings and hopefully have him healthy enough to fill whatever role fits the staff best in the playoffs. Hill and McCullers are 55 or 60 FV types, so that's likely Garcia's upside if things break right. 
Garcia is a very good athlete, which is what allows him to repeat his delivery, throw so many strikes, and have at least average command despite a delivery that has crossfire, recoil, and effort at release. We're hesitant to knock Garcia's delivery simply because it's unusual, or due to his size, because his performance at this age has also been remarkable. He has a rising fastball with which he operates up in the zone, and he knows exactly how to use his high spin curveball, which has been over 3000 rpm at times. A well-located fastball up, a high-spin curveball down, and a changeup down to keep hitters honest is a good combo, and Garcia knows how to use them in sequence to set up hitters. There's some question about his approach being too simplistic to work at the big league level, but again, we would bet on Garcia figuring out how to make it work. He'll open 2019 in Double-A and could be good enough to crack the Bombers bullpen late in the season.","TtDspHp7TRI","sa916944"

His 2018 included eight sterling starts in Low-A and 11 very solid starts in Hi-A, all as a teenager. 
Graterol has the making of a frontline starter, sitting 96-99 and hitting 100 mph often, mixing in a plus-flashing slider and a changeup that's above average at its best. He's a short strider and a bit of a dart-thrower, which is unusual for a pitcher that hits 100, but it helps Graterol throw more strikes than you would assume from a teenager hitting this kind of heat with an arm surgery in his past. The poor extension makes his velocity play lower than the radar gun readings, but with some incremental improvements in pitch execution and command, Graterol could shoot up our overall list, as he does more things like Sixto Sanchez than anyone else in the minors.","5VxhHnSA2hg","20367"

Hall has also made on-field progress throughout 2018. Early in the season, he was wild.

A creative sequencer, Honeywell's deep, unique repertoire is unlike any other pitcher in the minors. Though his fastball touches 98, his stuff is so diverse that he never has to pitch off of it. He can lob his curveball in for strikes, induce weak contact early in counts by throwing a cutter when hitters are sitting fastball, and he'll double and triple up on the changeup. What you see listed in Honeywell's tool grades as a splitter is actually a screwball. It wobbles home in the 79-82 mph range, while his true changeup is usually a little harder than that. The screwgie is more than a gimmick and can miss bats, though it’s best in moderation because it's a little easier to identify out of his hand, and hitters are able to recognize it after seeing it multiple times in the same at-bat.

He didn't hit as much as expected as a senior and some scouts questioned his defensive ability, competitiveness, and feel to hit, so he slipped to the second round despite flashing big power and being 17 on draft day, something that is generally really attractive to analytically-leaning clubs. Vientos performed fine in his pro debut, but broke out in his second year, crushing the Appalachian League at age 18 in 2018. He controlled the strike zone and hit for power while exhibiting very high exit velos for someone his age. Vientos is advanced mechanically, making him a potential 6 bat/6 power combination at maturity if he continues at this trajectory.

If the makeup has turned a corner and the hitting continues to progress, the main issue will be defensive fit. Vientos is a well below average runner who one scout described as 'athletic from the knees up,' to the point where the lack of quickness will limit him to being average defensively, but he's far from that right now. One Mets source drew a parallel to Nolan Arenado's makeup and defensive concerns, which quickly evaporated in the upper minors as he turned into the best third baseman in baseball, but that seems unlikely at this point.","ax1yE3rIWCs","sa3004720"

The sound of the ball off his bat during those BP side sessions was very distracting. Marsh stayed in Arizona during the spring of 2017 and was much more physical than most of his AZL peers. Marsh had statistical success there and in the Midwest League the following spring, before finally scuffling at Hi-A. 
Though he has above-average raw power, Marsh's in-game cut is more contact-oriented, geared for contact to the opposite field and back up the middle. During instructional league, Marsh was awkwardly swinging without a stride, likely not a swing change, but perhaps an exercise that forces him to clear his hips and improve his ability to pull the ball with power.

It's rare that a high school hitter from Chicago is this polished, especially one as young as Thomas, who was barely 18 on draft day. 
He runs well enough to project in center field (though his reads from the corners are much better right now and he might just be a plus corner glove, also like Gardner), which makes the unenthusiastic, frame-based power projection less concerning. There's some tweener fourth outfielder risk here because of the lack of power projection and potential move off of center field, but it's reasonable to hope some combination of contact, on base ability and defense make up for that and enable Thomas to be a regular.","Bo9Wh47-Wm4","sa3006892"

He looked like a well-rounded, first-division player while he was hitting with pleasantly surprising power (.282/.343/.432 with 30 extra-base hits in 85 games) at Hi-A St. Lucie during the season's first half, but like much less of one during a rough six weeks in the Arizona Fall League. In Fall League, Gimenez looked physically overmatched at the plate, likely due to exhaustion. He was still 19 when the Mets promoted him to Double-A for the season's final six weeks, and his sophomoric body had endured a 122-game season against older, more physically developed athletes before he had even set foot in Arizona. It's fair to project Gimenez to add strength, but because his frame is small, it'll probably be just the kind of strength that gives him season-long stamina, not huge raw power. But while big raw power is unlikely, if his feel for contact is refined in a way that prioritizes lift, it's possible that Gimenez will end up hitting for more power than we project in the same way Ozzie Albies has. Gimenez has excellent natural bat control and can pull his hands in to get the barrel on pitches that would jam other hitters, and he has feel for fully extending on balls away from him and roping them into the opposite-field gap. If he does, he might end up hitting a ton of doubles and out-slug our projections without hitting a lot of home runs, or he may naturally start lifting the ball like Albies did. In general, we like Gimenez as an above-average defensive middle infielder with advanced contact skills. We think he'll be a solid-average everyday player, and while we think it's unlikely, we can see a developmental path that leads to better production than that.","0daljrqAYUs","sa917114"

By the end of the month, however, White had 30 hits in 90 plate appearances and was slugging .763. 
He has made subtle changes to his lower half, drawing his front knee back toward his rear hip more than he did at Kentucky, and taking a longer stride back toward the pitcher. White is more often finishing with a flexed front leg, which has helped him go down and lift balls in the bottom part of the strike zone by adjusting his lower half instead of his hands.

He has been defensively advanced for years, both in his tools and his mental approach to the game, in part due to help from his brother. William projects as an above average defender with a plus arm. Contreras has also gotten stronger and is growing into his man strength after establishing a feel to hit, so he has a well-rounded approach now. He toned down his swing in 2018 and is slowly adding elements as he feels comfortable, rather than making a noisier swing work all at once. Contreras stands out because there are not many 21-year-olds who project for average to above offense along with above average defense, and have the makeup/mental part of the game under control without any major red flags like injuries. The scouts who like Contreras really like him--rounding up on both the tool grades due to makeup and his overall value due to a high floor at a position that's a wasteland in the majors right now. This top 10 could be in almost any order, and Contreras may be the guy with the biggest variance as to where various baseball people rank him, which is a positive when his ranking peers are mostly MLB-ready, heavily-pedigreed prospects with much more track record.","6knO4tYP-LM","sa872847"

He was also demoted from the Northwest League back to the AZL in 2017 for reasons seemingly unrelated to performance. The following spring, not only was Duran's velocity more stable -- in the 93-96 range -- but he was throwing strikes and had more consistent secondary stuff. 
While he can spin a good breaking ball, Duran's best secondary pitch is his changeup, which he sells with electric arm speed.

Gray’s size and the drop and drive nature of his delivery combine to create flat plane that plays well up in the zone. He’ll miss bats at the letters with his heater. Thanks to his athleticism, Gray repeats, and throws more strikes than is typical for someone fairly new to pitching who has this kind of stuff, with a notable proclivity for locating his fastball to his arm side. 
The slider can slurve out and even get kind of short and cuttery at times, but when it's well-located and Gray is on top of the ball, it’s a plus pitch. His changeup, which he seldom uses at the moment, is easy to identify out of the hand due to arm deceleration, and is comfortably below average. 
Because of the strike throwing, fastball efficacy, and ability to spin the breaking ball give him a good shot to play a big league role, and we've moved Gray up beyond where we had him pre-draft. The athleticism, small school pedigree, and position player conversion aspect of the profile indicates there’s significant potential for growth as Gray gets on-mound experience. He projects as No. 4 starter, with a chance to be more because of his late-bloomer qualities.","","sa3007475"

He signed for a $15 million bonus -- the Dodgers paid a dollar-for-dollar tax on his deal for exceeding their pool limit -- during a CBA era that was more lucrative for international players. So advanced was Diaz that at age 19, the Dodgers saw fit to send him directly to Hi-A Rancho Cucamonga the following year, and he performed admirably for what amounted to a season and a half before enjoying a statistical breakout at Double-A Tulsa starting late in 2017. His stock and performance reached a pinnacle in 2018; Diaz slashed .314/.428/.477 with Tulsa, homered twice and won MVP at the Futures Game in July. Shortly thereafter he was traded to Baltimore as the headline prospect in the Manny Machado deal. 
Diaz has a well-rounded collection of average tools that, in aggregate, promise to make him a valuable everyday big leaguer. He has slowly whittled down what was once a pretty big leg kick into something more simplistic, and it seems to have benefitted Diaz's timing without subtracting from his power. He can open up and get the bat head on pitches in, and he has feel for opposite-field contact if he's a little late on something away from him. We'd be surprised if Diaz became a 3-plus win annual WAR producer, but we think he's a very stable everyday outfield prospect who'll be big league ready in the next year and a half or so.","cdLpzBiXeNQ","sa912848"

Some of this success was probably because Casas was one of the oldest prospects in the 2019 graduating class, which prompted him to accelerate his schooling in 2017 and reclassify for the 2018 draft. Moving up a year made him age-appropriate for a high schooler in their draft year; at 18.4, he was basically average for a prep player. With that early-career acclaim came a change in the way opposing pitchers approached Casas. They began to pitch around him, and scouts often left Casas games having seen him swing just once or twice because he was constantly walking. Luckily Casas had a long track record of hitting in games, had participated in multiple home run derbies during his amateur summers, and posted gaudy exit velocities during team pre-draft workouts, so clubs knew what his offensive potential was. He has good hands and a plus arm that helped him pitch into the low-90's on the mound, but is a well-below average runner with poor lateral mobility. He played third base after signing (mostly during instructs though, as Casas injured his thumb sliding for a ground ball in June, needed surgery, and barely played during the summer) but expectations are he'll move across the diamond to first base in 2019 or 2020, where we think he'll be quite good. Casas' calling card is his bat and there's potential for a 60 hit, 70 game power, 80 raw power kind of package. The margin for error for a teenage first base-only types is very small, but we're also very high on Casas' bat.","900T_ozI7iY","sa3007634"

Garcia has filled out some in the intervening time, and has sneaky raw power that may be above average at maturity. That, in combination with clearly above average bat control and enough patience that Garcia lays off pitcher's pitches, is a rare combination for an 18-year-old middle infielder. You can see why Washington pushed him to Hi-A and why he continued performing. Garcia is an above average runner and thrower but may not stick at shortstop, in which case he'll be fine at second base.

For much of his pro career, Harrison has either been hurt or underperformed. Aside from his .270/.350/.480 season in 2017, he has struggled to make contact, especially in 2018, when he struck out in 37% of his plate appearances, and a minor league leading 215 times. Despite this, Harrison nearly posted yet another 20/20 season and improved so much as a defensive player that he's now considered plus in center. The Marlins sent him to the Arizona Fall League with a desire to see some kind of bat-to-ball improvement. Harrison responded by ditching his leg kick. His strikeout rate in Arizona was 25% -- better than the summer, but still not great -- and he hit for almost no power there. His issues with strikeouts weren't, in our opinion, caused by excessive movement in his swing but rather by things like breaking ball recognition, bat path, and hand-eye coordination. Those aren't things that can be remedied by mechanical changes, and we'd rather an athlete like this be moving a lot at the plate to help ensure he's getting to as much of that power as possible, even if it means living with a lot of strikeouts. There's a wide range of outcomes possible for a talent like this, ranging from Carlos Gomez to Colby Rasmus to B.J. Upton to Drew Stubbs to Jake Marisnick. Harrison is a premium athlete with good makeup who should get plenty of opportunity to cure his own ills at the big league level.

His high school coach, Jered Goodwin, now a FIU assistant, ran arguably the top travel program in Florida at the time, so Mountcastle had year-round reps in front of scouts for years. He's still largely the same player he was in high school in terms of raw tools: plus bat control, plus raw power, with fringy speed and no clear defensive home because he has issues throwing. He's played mostly shortstop and third base in pro ball but scouts keep comparing his profile to Nick Castellanos' and think he ends up in left field. 
There's some optimism that his arm will improve with a throwing program, or that he could play second base (which is worth a try), but usually these situations end with the player at the lower end of the defensive spectrum. Like Castellanos, Mountcastle also is a little too aggressive at the plate but has the bat control to keep his strikeout rates from getting too high. The projection here is something like a 55 bat and 55 power, maybe a bit less if the approach doesn't continue to improve, with below average speed and defensive value, wherever he ends up playing. We wish he were a little choosier at the dish -- that's a lower-risk, 2 WAR-type prospect. Mountcastle will start 2019 in Triple-A, so the wait shouldn't be long.","Mf-E2t1dIxo","sa874734"

He remains below-average in most aspects of catching, but isn't so bad that he'll surely have to move. He's not nearly as skilled a defender as Carson Kelly, but Knizner has a much better chance to make an offensive impact. Yadier Molina is signed through 2020, which creates the illusion of a catching logjam, but he's somewhat fragile and Knizer and Kelly's experience at corner infield spots (Knizner has played some first base as a pro, but did not in 2018) could enable the Cardinals to carry all three of them at some point.

He then reclassified and was suddenly on track to graduate and be draft eligible a year early, meaning every decision-making amateur evaluator in the country had to get in quickly to see a pitcher who had all this new velocity but with whom scouts had very little history. Then Bukauskas asked not to be drafted (he was, late, and didn't sign) so he could go to North Carolina. After a middling freshman year, he was dominant as a sophomore and in the early part of his junior year before his stuff was depressed during North Carolina's postseason games. It inflamed perviously held concerns that durability issues resulting from his size and a violent delivery might push Bukauskas to the bullpen. 
After parts of two pro seasons, we still don't have great feel for how Bukauskas will hold up under a pro workload. He hasn't had any arm issues, but missed two months due to a slipped disk in his thoracic spine, an injury he suffered in a car accident. Bukauskas was electric when he returned and became increasingly dominant towards the end of the summer before his stuff was seen by the entire industry in the Arizona Fall League. 
He'll flash 70-grade changeups and sliders on occasion, bump 98, and has added a cutter. His stuff would lose some zip late in Fall League outings, and he may be more of a 120-inning starter than true workhorse, which would cap his value at around 2.5 annual WAR.","KOAoxcF0A9E","sa829263"

But this vertical release also enables him to effectively change hitters' eye level by pairing fastballs up with breaking balls down, and he has a plus breaking ball. Woods Richardson works so quickly that it often makes hitters uncomfortable, though scouts love it. He's also shown some nascent changeup feel, but it will be hard to turn the cambio over consistently from his arm slot. Though he was one of the 2018 draft's youngest prospects, his frame is pretty mature, so we're not rounding up on the fastball even though he's still a teenager.

There's plenty to pick apart here if you want to: Singer's stuff still isn't loud, he doesn't get many whiffs from pro level hitters, his delivery turns off some scouts, and his breaking ball often lacks bite. 
Even scouts who like Singer think he has limited upside, but the results he got in the SEC and his long track record of durability are compelling. He has great feel for pitching and, we think, future plus command. Singer sneers and goes right at hitters, he's really competitive, and is likely to move up the pro ladder quickly.

Of course, the reason each individual player has strikeout issues can vary. Some hitters have feckless, over-aggressive approaches, while others can't recognize breaking balls or have a problem with lever length and get tied up inside. Florial's issues -- his strikeout rate has fallen between 27% and 32% each of the last three years -- appear to stem from his bat path and limited bat control. Stiff wrists cause his bat head to drag into the zone, which can cause him to be tardy on fastballs at the letters and, more frequently, flail at soft stuff dipping down and away from him. Yoan Moncada has similar issues that have yet to be remedied. 
Florial does enough other stuff that, even if the strike outs remain an issue, he could still be a valuable big leaguer. He crushes anything down and in, has sufficient plate coverage to hit fastballs middle away, and has enough power to do damage to the opposite field. He also has good ball/strike recognition so, again like Moncada, there should be power, walks, and up-the-middle defense. We think Florial is likely to be an exciting but flawed everyday player, though it's not audacious to think his relative youth (he was a 20-year-old at Hi-A in 2018) and inexperience (he also missed a year of reps due to a suspension for bad paperwork) leave more room for growth than we anticipate.","mYK2ssfvC80","sa874464"

He played at a couple of showcase events in the summer of 2017 and had some raw tools, but wasn't yet under consideration for the top few rounds of the baseball draft. He was, however, a top 100 football recruit, set to head to North Carolina to play wide receiver, where his father was on the coaching staff. Then in March, Adams had a coming out party at the heavily-scouted NHSI tournament near his high school, fulfilling the rosiest hopes some had of him eventually putting it together on the baseball field, as multiple scouts from all 30 teams watched him against strong competition for a few days. Scouts were hesitant at first, worried they might be overreacting, but eventually came to think that Adams' only athletic peer in recent draft history was Byron Buxton. 
Adams is a true 80 runner with raw power who projects to be a 60, and who flashed body and bat control that reminded scouts of Royce Lewis. All of this excitement came with almost zero track record, and Adams didn't face much strong competition after NHSI, meaning drafting him would be based purely on old-school scouting, as there weren't years of video of and performance from this flourishing incarnation of Adams. Once teams became enthused enough that multiple millions of dollars were in play, it appeared clear that baseball could overtake football. Several GMs, including the Angels' GM Billy Eppler, were in after NHSI to see Adams for themselves, and after Adell and Adams were their top pick in consecutive years, rival executives now view this risk/upside kind of prospect as Los Angeles' type. That trend appears to be more the result of opportunistic good fortune than a deliberate strategy, since there's an argument to be made that Austin Beck (who went to Oakland sixth overall in 2017) had less upside and a similar performance record to Adams; if the industry had simply seen Adams play in an NHSI-style setting for a couple more weeks, he could have been a top five pick candidate, just like Royce Lewis or Byron Buxton were after a strong summer of performance. This is all to say that the sky is the limit for Adams, and if he performs well in Low-A in 2019, he'll shoot up this list.","dsaEZPyd02Y","sa3008032"

Whether this is fixable has been the subject of many debates in draft rooms in the early first round. Bishop has rare physical tools for a college hitter. He's a plus runner and will post 70 run times to first on occasion with solid feel for center field and huge, playable power, so there's a chance for stardom here even if Bishop ends up with a below-average hit tool. It's unclear why Bishop's arm strength and accuracy became issues this year after they were assets earlier in his career, but it's such a small aspect of his skillset that it shouldn't be a concern unless his medical indicates it's a chronic issue.

He was holding a tailing 92-95 deep into starts, topping out at 97, and spinning in a dastardly, bat-missing breaking ball. Unrefined fastball control led to a lot of bullpen projection, but Webb hadn't pitched very much because of injury, so it seemed possible that it might yet improve. 
Early in 2019, Webb's stuff was down a bit, more 91-94 and touching 95, before he got popped for PEDs and was suspended for 80 games.

The 20-year-old was given an assignment that matched his loud tools (teams who saw him work out were putting 6's and 7's on his speed, arm, and defense at short) but not his readiness, and he was bad early in the year at Low-A Dayton. He came on, statistically, at the end of the year, but didn't walk much in either phase. Latin American players who have spent their entire lives playing ball back home, or in Florida or Arizona, sometimes struggle with the early-April chill of the Midwest League when they're first assigned there; as if being 20 in a full-season league after not playing for over a year wasn't enough, Garcia may have struggled with this. 2019 should be a more representative sample statistically of what Garcia is. There's no question about his run, field or throw tools, and he was seen at a bat-first prospect early in his Cuban career, so that might be in there, too. If he can develop some confidence around his offense, Garcia could quickly jump into 50 FV territory, which is where we had him last year based on how he worked out for teams.

At times his fastball has been in the upper-90s, cresting 100, but it was in the low-90s this spring and he was placed on he injured list thereafter with an oblique issue. 
Gonsolin's four-pitch mix looks like it was designed in a lab and considering the way his stuff works together, it may have been.

He'll also work a slider to his glove side and it has shocking, horizontal length considering Gonsonlin's arm slot. But the headline offering here is the changeup, a split-action cambio that bottoms out as it reaches the plate. Gonsolin uses it against both left and right-handed hitters and it's one of the best changeups in the minors.

Garcia could be next in line to jump into the 50 FV tier during the 2019 season, building on a solid pro debut in 2018, where he improved his already-impressive tool profile. To clarify any confusion, it's worth noting that there is another, very similar middle infield prospect with the Nationals of the same name who was also born in the same year. The Phillies' Garcia has an above average hit tool to go with above average speed, defense, and arm strength at shortstop, so it won't be a long journey to turn into a regular if he can maintain those current tools. He's played just 43 official minor league games and has an unsustainably-high .418 BABIP, but the performance also supports the standout skillset. Some scouts argue there isn't a plus tool here other than arm strength, so you can't stuff Garcia too high until he's done a little more in official games, but he's already among the top 200 prospects or so in baseball. Some see sneaky potential average raw power down the road, which Garcia could mostly get to in games if he ends up being the plus hitter that some are projecting, though some scouts see 45 hit and 40 power, given the limited pro looks they've had. It's also worth noting that Garcia has become close friends with Alec Bohm; the pair could team up to form half of the infield of the future in Philadelphia. Garcia will definitely be one to watch closely in 2019 as there's some in-season ceiling to his potential ranking, particularly if he can perform the way the Nationals' Luis Garcia did this past year; that Garcia reached High-A at age 18.","cVHO9Fx0oYc","sa3007295"

Throughout the summer, scouts realized that he was a clear top five round talent on the mound, but a truly elite prospect at the plate. Lowe flashed plus speed, a plus arm, and plus raw power from the left side, projecting as the rare big center fielder with hit and power tools. The concern was that Lowe's uphill, aggressive, power-oriented cut would limit his contact rate; after the Rays took him in the first round, his swing plane was flatter. In 2018, Lowe's older brother and fellow Rays farmhand, Nate, shockingly went from fringe prospect to passing his more famous sibling in prospect status. Josh hasn't put the loft back in his game swing, so he doesn't look much different than the No. 1 overall pick from his draft class, Phillies center fielder Mickey Moniak. Both posted solid, contact-oriented offensive seasons in the Florida State League at age 20 while playing a solid center field. The difference is that Lowe has plus raw power he could tap back into, while Moniak may eventually grow into just average raw power. Lowe is ticketed for Double-A in 2019 and has a very laid back demeanor, which can turn off some scouts, though others see it as a sign he can handle the grind of the game and break through like his older brother did last year.","FpeotjI5qYU","sa917926"

In his senior spring, things starting changing; he was getting into the low-90s, but it was still raw enough and abrupt enough of a change that it made sense for McClanahan to go to school, now committed to South Florida. He had another velo bump early in his college career, which eventually led to Tommy John surgery. Buzz grew in scouting circles as his post-surgery stuff was elite and after his first start of 2018, a heavily-scouted matchup with North Carolina, McClanahan looked like a top five overall pick. In that game, he hit 100 mph and flashed an above average slider and changeup along with enough feel to project as a starter. From then on, things started to unravel, until the Rays popped the local kid 31st overall. McClanahan had some minor issues -- a finger injury and fluctuating velo as weather and workload dictated -- but more worrisome to scouts were both his maturity and how he fared when his fastball was more of a 6 than an 8, and his command was a 3 or 4 instead of a 5. Most college pitchers can succeed with 55 or 60 stuff and below average command, but McClanahan struggled and showed it on the mound. The optimistic case is that a change of scenery, coaching, and workload (with less pressure) will help tease out that top five overall pick version of McClanahan, while the pessimistic case is that what we saw down the stretch is indicative of a future as a streaky power reliever with limited feel.","ntk-CU1Bo6A","sa3008547"

He had an up-and-down sophomore spring. Rolison came out of the chute blazing hot and had top-10 pick buzz for the first month of the season, then slowly regressed. Scouts thought he needed a delivery adjustment in to make him more direct to the plate, a way to improve his fastball control. They also thought he was too reliant on his curveball. To that point, hitters late in the season would sit on the pitch, knowing he had trouble locating his fastball and that he barely threw his changeup. It led to some bad outings, including one at South Carolina where he allowed 11 runs. 
Since being drafted, Rolison has worked more frequently with all three of his pitches, throwing 66% of his pitches for strikes, and his velocity has remained in the 92-94 range even as he throws every fifth day (mostly) rather than once a week.

Both Tejeda and Jones are speedy shortstops with rare power for the position who also have issues making contact. Tejeda is rangy and athletic, and has good defensive footwork and plenty of arm for the infield's left side. His hands are just okay, so evaluations of his defense can vary depending on what individual scouts think is important to play the position, and some teams want to see him tried in center field. 
Tejeda has plus-plus bat speed and his hands work in a tight, lift-friendly circle, but he's so explosive that at times he's out of control (this is where the strikeouts come from). He managed to get to the power at Hi-A in 2018, when he homered 19 times, and if he can stay at shortstop and continue to mash like that in games, he'll be a good everyday player. We have Greg Jones in the 45 FV tier of the 2019 draft, which puts him in the mid-to-late first round; we like Tejeda a bit more than that and think he'd be in the 10-15 range on a draft board.

He is very slight of build, so much so that there's skepticism regarding his power projection that there is not for other players of similar age, skill, and level (like Brayan Rocchio with Cleveland), who have a better chance of developing pop. 
Excellent at both middle infield spots, Marcano has a shot to be a plus glove at short or second at peak.

Lawson's velocity has climbed and his breaking ball, which was in the 68-72 mph range in high school, now has more power to it and rests in the mid-70s.

Others think Allen is serviceable, and would gladly give up what he lacks on defense for what he'd provide at the catching position on offense: huge power, rare for the position. 
Allen elevates the ball with authority and has been doing so since college. He slugged .728 as a junior (while facing questions about competition quality in addition to the defensive stuff) and he has 50 or more extra base hits in each of the last two seasons. It's All-Star offensive ability for a catcher, it's just that most of the industry doesn't like him at the position. Perhaps what San Diego has done with Francisco Mejia (let him catch pitchers he can handle) will serve as precedent for what they may try with Allen, whose issues are admittedly different than Mejia's. They could let Allen catch pitchers who are adept at holding runners on their own, give him a start at first now and then, and let him take high-leverage at-bats off the bench against righties the rest of the time.

Pardinho grew up in Brazil, which has a large Japanese population, and he has some Japanese heritage; his windup clearly points to a Japanese influence. 
The issue here is that Pardinho is listed at 5-foot-10 and 155 pounds, and isn't much bigger than that right now, though he has a sturdy build. 18-year-old pitchers need to have big velocity, or projection to add velocity, to be top prospects since they generally start losing velocity in their mid-20s; that innate velocity, or projection for it, offers some margin for error. There are exceptions to this benchmark, like Zack Greinke, cases where a pitcher has been a pitchability type with above average stuff from his teenage days all the way into a big league career, but those instances are very rare. Pardinho will sit 92-95 and hit 96 mph early in outing and settle around 90-93 later. His curveball flashed above average as an amateur and he mixed in a slider that lagged behind, but those two pitches are both average to above now. They're different pitches but still can run together at times, common for a younger pitcher. Parindho's changeup is his fourth pitch now and it's around average, but he separated himself with above average command projection, which helped him post gaudy numbers in his pro debut in the Appalachian League at 17. 
Pardinho is undoubtedly advanced and projects as a No. 3 or 4 starter if things go well, but he was essentially pitching like a college senior in a league where a college senior can dominate and then never get to Double-A. Pardinho is a prospect because he's advanced enough to pitch like a 22-year-old when he's 17 years old. We'd just like to see either his stuff improve -- or hold that velocity for the whole game -- or see performance against more advanced hitters before we shoot him up the list like he's the next Greinke.","mkTCI4QKkSM","sa968102"

Newton is much more of a physical marvel on which to dream than he is a polished performer. At a very projectable 6-foot-4, he's the size of an NFL wide receiver prospect and already has considerable raw power that projects to plus at maturity. It's rare for infielders this size to stay at shortstop, but Newton looks natural and comfortable there even though he clearly hasn't totally grown into his body yet and appears uncoordinated at other times. Even if he outgrows short, switch-hitting third basemen with power are extremely valuable. Newton has less bat control and feel to hit than his .280 batting average would otherwise indicate, and there's a chance he's always strikeout prone and doesn't get to some of his power. But it's unreasonable to expect a switch-hitting teenager this size to have fully sentient bat control, and the ceiling on Newton if everything actualizes is superstardom. This is one of the more high-variance prospects in the minor leagues.","","sa917119"

The injury washed away the rest of 2016 and essentially all of 2017, as a visibly hobbled Lewis stopped and started baseball activity several times due to ongoing issues with the knee. He even began 2018 with a month-long stay on the injured list because he wasn't a full go when spring training began. He was healthy for the rest of 2018 but his performance was mixed, and his tools beneath where they were in college. He was clearly less explosive than most of his peers at the Futures Game were, but of course at that point he had only been playing healthy, regular baseball for about two months. 
This spring, the physical ability that had scouts calling Lewis the most talented prospect on Cape Cod -- and that drove him to near the top of 2016 draft boards -- has returned. That injured right knee looks healthy as it twists and bends through contact. It's shouldering more of a mechanical burden now than it was in 2017, certainly, and Lewis is taking healthy but comfortable hacks with the same natural flyball loft he exhibited in college. He's hit a few impressive spring training homers but has also swung through quite a few fastballs in the zone, some in the 90-92 mph range. Teams were concerned about potential strikeout issues in college, concerns that were exacerbated by the small-school competition he faced, which served to limit the confidence teams had in his performance. This year is not only important for Lewis' development but for the industry's understanding of his profile. He finally appears healthy and he has heart-of-the order offensive talent so long as he doesn't have severe contact issues.","XQKmDL-5xqQ","19508"

The more recently a source has seen Alcantara, the nuttier the reports get. Now that he has access to pro-quality athletic facilities, he's already put on some good weight and has been hitting for more power during batting practice in the Dominican Republic. At one point he hit several BP homers, not just over the outfield fence, but over the fence that encloses the complex itself. 
Built like Lewis Brinson and Cody Bellinger were at the same age, Alcantara has better feel for contact than either of them did as teens. Hitters this size often struggle with strikeouts due to lever length and while Alcantara hasn't faced much pro quality velocity to stress test this aspect of his offense, there are no early indications that strikeouts are going to be an issue for him. It may take physical maturation and little else to enable a breakout, and the comps industry personnel are placing on Alcantara (Devon White, Dexter Fowler, and Alex Rios to name a few) are very strong. It will be interesting to see how the Yankees handle his 2019 assignment, as it sounds like his skillset is ready for the GCL but it may behoove the team to leave him in the less-scouted DSL as a way of hiding him from clubs who don't scout pro ball there.","","sa3008752"

We believe Vargas was originally slated to wait until 2019 to sign a pro contract (sources have indicated to us that it was to be with Cincinnati) but the Yankees had enough pool space to convince him to change his mind and sign a year earlier for about the same money.

He was one of the best performing amateur hitters from Venezuela in his signing class (just ahead of Everson Pereira, who's further down this list), and he was also a plus runner who could've been converted to catcher given his quickness, arm strength, and squatty, powerful frame. But the Yankees didn't want to slow down his bat by asking him to learn to catch. Some scouts who had a one or two game look at this summer didn't love Cabello's non-projectable frame, and they rounded down if he didn't hit in those short looks. But those who saw him for more than a few games saw the advanced bat amateur scouts saw. 
One enthusiastic scout described Cabello's running as plus, though he's not the typically graceful, long striding plus runner. That scout he said had a 'grinding gait, full effort, kicking up grass as he runs like the rooster tail of a speed boat.' In addition to potential plus hit and run tools, there's above-average arm strength and raw power, and now the start of a strong statistical performance record. And if things go askew at the plate, the notion that Cabello could catch is interesting. One Yankee source described Cabello as an 80 makeup guy, often a prerequisite to consider sending a player behind the plate He's a well-rounded offensive player who looks like an up-the-middle defensive fit of some kind.

He is an above-average runner with an above-average arm and plus center field instincts, which makes him an above-average defender there. He'll likely grow into average raw power, but below-average game power due to a more gap-to-gap approach.

Then he blew out about halfway through his sophomore year, requiring Tommy John surgery. He missed all of 2017, then came back for an age-22 redshirt junior year and appeared to be all the way recovered, which lead to the Nationals taking him in the second round. Early in his career, Crowe looked to be on the same trajectory as Joba Chamberlain (who also slipped in the draft due to elbow and knee concerns), which would mean ending up in the bullpen while throwing in the high-90's with a power breaking ball. Post surgery, he's a little more starter-looking than that, working 91-94 and hitting 95 mph, with a changeup that has emerged as his best offspeed pitch, and a high-spin curveball and slider that both are average to above.

As the summer wore on, Seigler grew on scouts, was chosen as the backup catcher for Team USA, and quickly took the starting job from eventual Marlins second rounder Will Banfield. Seigler was able to do this (and eventually become a first round pick) due to his innate present feel for contact at the plate and receiving behind it. In addition to solid contact skills, Seigler also started to lift the ball in games closer to the draft and get to all of his fringy raw power. This polish helped to make teams less worried about his advanced age relative to his prep peers, and some scouts thought he was among the top 5-10 players in the entire draft.

There are some similarities to another prep catcher from the prior draft: M.J. Melendez of the Royals. Melendez is a little twitchier while Seigler is a little more advanced in terms of skills.

His second half with Double-A Birmingham was less successful, and just as Basabe appeared to be adjusting to the better pitching in August, he would again struggle in the Arizona Fall League. Perhaps the most notable takeaway from the AFL is that Basabe's instincts in center field are not great, and he may be better suited for a corner despite his speed. If that's the case (it'd be fair to assume Basabe was gassed during the AFL and to just exclude that look from consideration) then the swing and miss aspect of the profile (27% K% last year) becomes a little scary. But Basabe has a potent collection of physical tools, he's walked at an above-average clip, his modest power plays in games because he lifts the ball, and all of that should enable him to be a second division regular.","xQYw0z5Pmvs","sa736915"

The pure stuff hasn't change and it's top of the line: a 95-97 mph heater that has hit 101 mph, a power curveball that's anywhere from 60 to 70 depending on the day, and a changeup that flashes 55 or 60 at its best. His command is now a 30 that we project to be a 40. But he's still a teenager, so there's a chance that things click for him and he finds 45 command and 50 control, which would be the minimum to stick as a starter with this kind of stuff. Medina's issues aren't physical -- his delivery is fine and his arm stroke is clean. Instead, the problem appears to be mostly mental. He'll throw well in the bullpen, only to have things will snowball for him in game situations. One source described his issues as stemming from a need for greater mental maturity and to not be so hard on himself, which are exactly the kinds of traits that come with general social maturity. That said, this sort of stuff rarely comes with starter command, so Medina is probably either a high-wire act reliever with bonkers stuff or a starter with the stuff ratcheted down a bit, similar to what Touki Toussaint has done the last couple seasons.","CULpv2BOf-0","sa928510"

He had a strong track record of performance in high school, but concerns about his power projection arose during Rutherford's first full season, when he slugged just .348. One could point to his age (Rutherford was as old as a junior college prospect on draft day) as an indicator that should have been tempered our expectations of his power growth in the first place. But really, Rutherford's swing, while picturesque, is just geared for all-fields doubles. He has some low-ball, home run power to his pull side, but otherwise does damage peppering the gaps and third baseline. Half of his 2018 doubles were struck to left of center field.

It's an approach that's typically shiftable, but Gonzalez is also a good bunter and runs well to combat this. Like Rutherford ahead of him, it's tough to project corner outfielders with middling power as average or better regulars. Rutherford is younger and perhaps has a better shot to grow into more, while Gonzalez has the superior feel for contact and might end up a 6 bat who doesn't need to hit for power to profile.

Mostly though, Jones is good because he makes lots of hard, line drive contact and is a plus runner.

Collecting stats from summer showcase events, or even spring games when prep hitters face pro-quality pitching, is one way to pinpoint how advanced a prospect is beyond a pure scouting report, and is something almost no clubs did systematically until the last half dozen years or so. Jackson is a perfect example of the limitations of this practice. 
He stood out on the showcase circuit with an infielder's footwork and actions (though his hands were inconsistent) and potentially above-average offense. But Jackson's performance was generally below average in this setting and he struck out a lot, so he was shifted into the fourth to fifth round area that often sends this sort of player to college. In the spring, Jackson was going off against poor competition in South Alabama and we were hesitant to shift his grade on that basis until we were told that he got glasses to correct some vision issues that had contributed to his summer disappointment. Now, his spring performance could still end up meaning little, but there was a shot he was a new prospect, and we never got a pre-draft opportunity to see him against good pitching. With that optimism in mind, we ranked him 31st in the 2018 draft class but the Angels were able to get him at 57th overall, as many clubs now run their draft off of models that lean heavily on summer performance when there's bulk and Jackson was at almost every event.
Jackson hit seven homers with above average production across the board in 43 pro games after signing, and it's looking like he may have been underrated by a purely numbers-based approach to the draft. We see a potential 50 or 55 on every tool and at least a third base fit in pro ball, if not a chance to play middle infield, which translates to a strong regular.","cy7v3sfh_sU","sa3007740"

When he arrived in the spring of 2018, he had added sculpted muscle mass to a prototypical frame, and his fastball was humming in at 94-97 early during spring outings. After some time in extended spring Ttaining, Soriano spent the end of last summer in Low-A as a 19-year-old, and had issues with walks. Though his delivery is devoid of violence, he struggles with release consistency and has scattershot fastball control as a result. Soriano's feel for locating his terrific curveball is often superior to his fastball command, and while this approach is becoming more acceptable in the majors, he'd ideally refine the latter. 
It's odd to look at Soriano's numbers and argue that he took a step forward last year, but he accomplished a third of the things we hoped he'd develop -- more velocity, better command, and a better changeup or some other third offering -- before turning 20. If either of the last two components fails to progress, Soriano will end up in the bullpen. If they both do, he'll be a mid-rotation starter.","CUj52ZM2wzU","sa916702"

Dubon was acquired (along with Travis Shaw) as part of a lopsided package for Tyler Thornburg. His elite hand-eye coordination and bat control drive a contact-oriented offensive profile. Since coming over from Boston, Dubon has thickened his once frail-looking frame and improved upon some of the things that limited his in-game power. He was rotating better early in 2018, with the timing of his hip/hand spearation being better, too, and he was no longer ditching his leg kick with two strikes. His 2016 Portland and 2017-2018 Colorado Springs slugging outputs are probably cariacatures of his true talent level, but Dubon should at least have doubles power. Defensively, Dubon is passable at shortstop and second base. He saw time in center field during the 2016 Fall League but hasn't played there since. Lots of scouts like him as a super utility type, but Dubon will be 25 in July and he hasn't played anywhere other than the middle infield at any point in his career, save for that Fall League. It's more likely he gets a chance to be Milwaukee's everyday shortstop in 2019 and, provided he hasn't lost a step due to the ACL tear, we like him as a low-end regular there. ","MgNeizABbjY","16530"

It's similar to how Clint Frazier looked at the same stage, though Frazier had a long summer of production, faced strong prep competition, and still only went fifth overall. Beck's pro debut revealed some weaknesses that aren't evident against mediocre prep pitching and he was clearly overmatched in the AZL during his first pro summer and often visibly frustrated.

He remains one of the more physically gifted players not only in this system, but in all of the minor leagues. He is a no-doubt 80 runner who circled the bases during an inside-the-park home run in the Dominican this winter in just 14.40 seconds.

His lower half usage in the box is sub-optimal, he too often expands the zone, and he frequently settles for middling, opposite-field contact. 
These have been Mateo's issues for over seven years now, and with each passing season, they're less and less likely to improve. But because Mateo has such prodigious athletic gifts and is going to play somewhere up the middle (he has the physical tools for shortstop and has looked fine there in big league trials this spring, but remains procedurally immature), he's likely to force his way on the field somehow, and he has a better chance of making a big league impact than everyone below him on this list.

Pitchers lose velocity as they age, so many teams prefer a more conventional delivery and arm stroke, and a pitcher with average stuff and good feel who can grow into power stuff, rather than a power pitcher who has to learn feel only when his stuff declines. The recent track record of prep pitchers who hit 98-100 before the draft is riddled with injuries and command regression. With prep pitching being so subject to specific team tastes to try to avoid busts and attrition, many teams are out on Espino on Day 1 and others, particularly the more progressive clubs that value velo, spin rate, high octane stuff in shorter stints, and area control with that stuff, are interested in the 20s and 30s.","","sa3011495"

Instead of reclassifying and enter the 2015 draft as an 18-year-old, Beer skipped his high school senior year completely and early-enrolled in January at Clemson. He wasn't on the radar for the top couple rounds, so scouts weren't sure he'd perform well, but Beer went on to have one of the best freshman years in college baseball history: .369/.535/.700 with 18 homers, 62 walks, and 27 strikeouts. 
The pessimistic view is that Beer is a player with old skills that peaked that season, as his stats regressed a bit from historic to merely among the best. The optimistic view is that Beer has impact plus-plus raw power, a long track record of production and will fit as an everyday 1B/DH type. We're a bit on the pessimistic side, as Beer is a 20 runner whose athleticism has backed up. He may only fit at DH now and we worried his swing was grooved enough that the hit tool may only be a 40, but with plenty of walks and power. The slippery slope to platoon DH is in sight, so we'd like to see some higher minors performance before we adjust our projections. 
His pro debut was strong and he'll likely spend this year at Hi- and/or Double-A at age 22, age-appropriate for prospects, which will show us where he is on the spectrum of expected performance from Dan Vogelbach to Nate Lowe, or maybe Rhys Hoskins at the very high end.","QgU3Pu8OJ4A","sa3006658"

Offensively, Walls started driving the ball more and doing some extra base damage when he was getting into good counts. The raw tools are still mostly average and he was 22 years old in Low-A, a function of the Rays' middle infield depth blocking a deserved promotion, so there isn't amazing upside here.

We've seen him hit oppo homers but it comes from quality, barreled contact rather than raw strength and power. It's an atypical offensive recipe for a first base prospect, and it's rare for contact-centric first baseman to work out, especially when they hit right-handed.

The setting in which you scout a player can do wonders and the Team USA look didn't give Frank much of chance to show what he could do. Scouts who saw Frank in pro ball, after the Rays popped him in the second round, see a slightly lesser version of Taylor Walls, another under-tooled Rays middle infielder with lots of feel. Frank is seen as more of a second baseman going forward and his 45 raw power, 50 speed, and 50 defense still aren't loud, but his ability to hit, take a good at-bat, and have advanced feel for the game give Frank the look of a potential low-end regular who could move quickly through the minors.","","sa3006660"

If there's suddenly more lift here then Castro could be a top 100 prospect by mid year. He's going to stay at short (plus range, average hands, above-average arm) but the average big league shortstop had a 95 wRC+ last year and Castro is a very aggressive hitter likely to run below-average OBPs.

A polished strike-thrower with four good pitches, he reached Double-A as a 19-year-old back in 2017 before he became the centerpiece of the Justin Verlander deal. Advanced though he was, various injuries have robbed Perez of innings. He has yet to throw more than 86 frames in an entire season, so while he may be fairly advanced for someone his age, and definitely for someone who has pitched so little, the industry has yet to see his stuff hold up for a whole summer of starter's innings. 
In 2016, he had knee trouble; in 2018, it was a lat strain, then shoulder inflammation. An ominous trap issue popped up during the early parts of 2019 spring training but Perez was back on the mound quickly and sitting his usual 93-96 into late-March. A strong-bodied 21-year-old, the cement is likely dry on Perez's stuff. His high three-quarters slot creates ride to his fastball as well as downward vertical action on his curveball, and those two traits typically pair well together. While Perez's curveball is his prettiest pitch, his best secondary offering is the changeup. There are times when Perez will come across the baseball and create screwball action on the change, and it runs, sometimes unhittably, onto the glove side corner of the plate. But mostly, it's used as a swing-and-miss pitch that bottoms out beneath the strike zone just as it reaches the plate. Perez has mid-rotation stuff and strike-throwing ability, but needs a fully healthy season to be valued at that level across the league. ","","sa873722"

The tools are for real: plus raw power, plus arm strength, above-average bat control, speed and defense in right field and, until 2018, an unassailable record of performance. Still, corner-only hitters with approach issues -- Hays is a free swinger with a pull-heavy approach -- run the risk of having their lack of discernment taken advantage of in the majors with little defensive value left to fall back on. After reaching Baltimore in 2017, 2018 was a nightmare for Hays: he struggled out of the gate, had his approach tinkered with to try to fix things only to have it not work, then injured his ankle and needed surgery. He missed two months and continued struggling when he returned. Some rival clubs see a buy-low opportunity and would love to take a chance on Hays' tools, but the Orioles probably aren't selling low, with the rebuilding club offering an easy road to MLB playing time for the foreseeable future. There's big offensive talent here if Hays can bounce back and find an approach that works in the big leagues.

He is also big and athletic with a smooth delivery and arm action, so there's the classic projection you're looking for.

That said, Akin's build isn't seen as a huge problem going forward, as it hasn't impacted his stuff, and most think he just needs to keep it in check a bit. Sources indicated to us that had he not hit his innings limit late in 2018, he would've gotten a big league look in September. The condition of Baltimore's pitching staff is certainly favorable for a soonish Akin debut, and he'll likely open 2019 in Triple-A. 
He has above-average big league stuff, especially for a lefty: he sits 92-95 and hits 98 mph, mixing in a solid average slider and a plus changeup. His command ranges from 40 to 60 depending on the start, and Akin's build often leads scouts to believe this is due to his conditioning. We're wary of discounting a player just because he doesn't fit traditional rubrics for success, and baseball is littered with unusual frames and mechanics, but Akin has also had hamstring and oblique issues. The stuff is of the No. 4 to No. 4/5 starter range, but there's also a chance Akin ends up in the bullpen.

At first blush, he's an unimpressive athlete who sits around 90 mph with his fastball, and throws from a lower slot that makes you wonder if he's an obvious reliever. Sure, the curveball flashes plus and you've noticed he commands all of his pitches, which might enable an average changeup to be a successful third weapon. As you dig a little deeper, you notice that Lowther hides his arm behind his body for much of his delivery and that he has nearly seven feet of down-mound extension, which screws with hitters' feel for timing his fastball and helps it play up. 
Most scouts don't like pitchers who work up in the strike zone, but there is a specific type who can make this work and we think Lowther is exactly that type. The formula is to get down the mound, throw from a lower release point, and have a fastball that 'rises'' -- that's rare to create from a low slot -- and command it to parts of the zone where hitters are vulnerable; Lowther does all of these things. He has below-average velocity, but we think the fastball is a 55 pitch with these separators, and some scouts think his changeup plays up for the same reason. With all that in mind, you see Lowther in a different light: as a durable innings-eating starter with a long track record of success, three 55-to-60 grade pitches and command, along with the pitchability and deception qualities that help ensure he'll still stick in a rotation if his raw stuff takes a step backward. Lowther turns 23 in April and likely starts the season in Double-A, but he may be one of the top five starters in the Orioles organization by midseason. He's about as low risk of a pitching prospect as you'll see among those who haven't been above A-ball.

In the autumn though, he was posting 70 and 80-grade run times to first base, and his range is center field is perhaps the best Baltimore will have seen since Ed Reed. Offensively, McKenna's abilities fall somewhere between that incredible first half and his lousy late-summer showing at Double-A Bowie. He doesn't have much raw power but he may hit an awful lot of doubles by slashing balls down each baseline, and by turning dribbling gap liners into hustle doubles. Big league pitching may eventually find locations to attack McKenna that prevent him from getting to his brand of power -- he struggled to do anything with pitches down and in during Fall League, for instance -- and if that's true, he may end up as a fourth outfielder, but we tenatively have him projected as a low-end regular in center field.","u90vH-3V-x0","sa875055"

His 13-start Northwest/Sally League tour, during which he walked just 19 in 54 innings, was the first step toward quelling concerns about his viability as a starter, though we're still somewhat apprehensive here at FanGraphs. 
Crouse's repertoire depth is not the issue. Based on his pitch usage during instructional league, his changeup seemed to be a developmental priority, and he has indeed made progress with it. It now comfortably projects to average, while Crouse's fastball/breaking ball combination has been excellent since he was a high school underclassman.  He incorporates all kinds of crafty veteran wrinkles into his delivery's cadence on occassion. An extra shoulder wiggle, a Travoltaian gyration of the hips, the occasional quick-pitch -- all sorts of things designed to take hitters by surprise. Scouts often sentence quirky, visibly fiery and emotional hurlers to late-inning duty, and we do think Crouse would thrive in such a role, but view these traits as positives. Crouse has a unique build and delivery, and is a very short strider whose 5-foot-4 extension sucks some of the perceived velo out of his fastball. This, plus the lower slot, might make him unusually vulnerable to lefties despite his velocity.

He struck out 140 hitters in 129 innings at Double-A. He remains a fairly spotty strike-thrower, but his three-pitch mix should enable him to continue to start, though probably as a 120 or 130-inning type rather than a true workhorse, which also makes sense considering Hearn's health history. He has rare lefty starter velocity and generally sits 93-96. A 95 mph average fastball would rank third among southpaw starters in baseball, just behind James Paxton and Blake Snell. Hearn can dump in his average curveball for strikes and his changeup has slowly turned into an average pitch, too. The cambio may yet have some developing to do as Hearn worked more heavily off his breaking ball early in his career and has lost a lot of reps due to injury.

He became the fallback option for clubs who were in pursuit of Shohei Ohtani, one of which was Texas, and he signed for $2.8 million in early-March of 2018. The timing of the deal, Martinez's age relative to other first-year prospects, and the lack of game action he had seen since defecting made his early-2018 developmental path tough to anticipate. The Rangers ended up starting him in the DSL (government processes and paperwork probably had something to do with that) and then skipped him over the AZL and sent him to the Northwest League for the final two months of the summer.  
His Fall League stint, though, was more telling. At that point, he had played enough to be sharp again, but not so much as to be gassed, and the opposing pitching in Arizona was an age-appropriate challenge while the NWL was arguably not. And Martinez's showing in the AFL was fine. He has all sorts of tricks for trying to reach base; he'll bunt for hits, he'll show bunt and then try to poke liners over the heads of approaching infielders, he'll occasionally walk toward the front of the batter's box during the pitcher's delivery and try to slash awkward contact somewhere while giving himself a head start down the line. Martinez's bat head drags into the zone a little bit and while he can adjust his lower half to alter the vertical placement of his barrel, he can also get tied up by velo inside. He projects as a middling offensive player with plus speed, and a capable defender in center. He may be a second division regular but is probably a platoon or fourth outfielder on a contending team. He'll get his first taste of full-season ball in 2019.","cZQFOrcLKzY","sa3005607"

That last outcome's existence, unlikely as it may be, puts prospects like Javier in a kind of rarified air, even when they haven't yet done anything, and Javier hasn't. 
When should we start to worry about all the injuries? Since signing in 2015, Javier has played in just 50 games while dealing with various maladies. He was in street clothes during part of 2015 instructs for reasons unknown to us, he played in just nine games in 2016 due to a hamstring strain, was healthy in 2017, then missed all of 2018 with a torn labrum in his non-throwing shoulder. This spring, he strained his quad and did not break camp with an affiliate. His frame has filled out and looked explosive, and during the spring, he was noticeably stronger and more powerful than he was when he signed. Javier's body, bat speed, swing foundation, and defensive fit is the stuff of stardom, but we have little-to-no data on important things like plate discipline and feel for contact, and the injury history has been troubling.

He may start trading some contact for power (his early-season strikeout and fly ball rates would seem to indicate this might be happening) but that may require more selectivity to work. Miranda's swing is currently bottom-hand heavy and he doesn't rip the bat through contact the way most power hitters do. He's been fine putting quality, low-lying contact into play to his pull side so far, but may be best served to hit for more power, especially if he eventually moves off short.

His low, three-quarters slot creates movement on his changeup that pairs well with the two-seamer and also gives right-handed hitters a tougher look at his loopy curveball. He could have four above-average pitches at peak if you count the four- and two-seamers as two separate offerings, but none of it will matter if Mata's 2018 strike-throwing is the norm going forward. The consensus is that he has feel for creating effective movement on his pitches but not for locating them yet. Proponents think due to his age that Mata will improve and become a No. 4 starter.

For now, Nova's approach is rather hedonistic, and he's talented enough to make that work, at least for a while.

Mike Olt, Juan Francisco, Matt Davidson, and Pedro Alvarez are recent examples of players with offensive skills who struggled to overcome their issues with strikeouts. But Dalbec is also more athletic than most of those low-contact, corner sluggers, and looked great at third base during the Fall League. Realistically, Dalbec's issues limit him to a bench or platoon role, largely enabled by his ability to play third base well. But because there's superlative power here, the ceiling is sky high if things suddenly click with the bat. Dalbec also spent time pitching in college (he was 91-93 with an average slider), a secondary skill that is of increasing interest to teams, though it's still just largely considered to be a parlor trick to show off during a blowout.","oP7cYGSzG4M","sa857701"

The 38 innings he threw at Low-A to round out 2018 were dominant, as Abreu recorded 68 strikeouts, most of which were accrued with either of his two excellent breaking balls, which he has better feel for locating than he does his mid-90s fastball. 
There's considerable industry doubt regarding Abreu's ability to start, the result of several factors. The lack of total innings creates reasonable doubt about him handling a 140-plus inning workload, and the lack of fastball command, along with Abreu's mediocre changeup, are also cited as pitfalls. As long as Abreu's breaking ball command refines though, he may have the tools to attack lefties and get ahead of hitters even if these other components are sub-optimal. His 40-man addition makes it more likely that he spends the early part of his big league career in the bullpen, but he may be a dominant multi-inning piece and could evetually transition into the rotation.

Going back to what's rare about Rodriguez, he seems to have it all, except for maybe an ideal present delivery and, obviously, stateside pro performance. This is about as high as we can rank a teenage pitching prospect who has only been seen a handful of times and hasn't really faced many hitters who can handle his stuff, but there's lots of room to grow on this 40+ FV if this trajectory continues.","_Jj3rLa-Lm4","sa3009991"

Adolfo's early career was mired in strikeouts and injury. He struck out at a 43% clip in his first season, missed most of 2015 due to a gruesome leg fracture, and then broke his hamate a month into 2016 and hit for no power after he returned. 
While he continues to strike out at a somewhat troubling rate (30% combined over the last two seasons), Adolfo has performed each of the last two years despite playing through an elbow injury that required Tommy John in 2018. He's grown into the power expected of him as an amateur and has slugged just shy of .460 as an age-appropriate regular at Low- and Hi-A. Back from Tommy John during the Spring of 2019, Adolfo looked buff, but stiff. The power is still there, but so too is the risk he ends up as a DH.

Of course, Peters' upside is enticing if he gets to his mammoth raw power anyway, which to this point, he has. This is predicated on him playing center field, which considering Peters is built like a young Adam Dunn, is no guarantee. He's a plus runner underway but it takes a while for him to reach top speed.

Once that situation resolved, Armenteros signed for $3 million, then came stateside and looked concerningly raw, but clearly talented. His timing and breaking ball recognition were especially poor, but he hadn't seen live pitching for a long time, meaning it could have been due to rust.

The Athletics pushed him to Low-A as a 19-year-old in 2018 and Armenteros posted a serviceable .277/.374/.401 line while striking out at a disquieting 34% clip. The K% is less worrisome because of his age, but he does have a bat path that limits the scope of his contact and some kinetic connectivity issues that cause him to rely solely on his dynamic hand speed to generate power.

The combination of the 2018 struggles and somewhat shaky standing on the defensive spectrum makes it imperative that Neuse have a bounce back 2019 performance. He's a baseball rat and younger than similarly-skilled players we've written up so far (like Mets third baseman J.D. Davis), so we're a little more bullish on a rebound here than we are elsewhere.

But as he has accumulated statistics in pro ball, he looks much more unique than his profile's bird's eye view would indicate. He strikes out 30% of the time, which is fairly common for prospects like this. But he incredibly only slugged .370 last year while still managing to homer 22 times, and Benson's ground ball rate is a minuscule 28%. He walked at an encouraging 16% clip last year. Still just 20, Benson remains a tooled up project with a huge red flag, but now has several underlying statistical traits of interest. He'd be higher on most other teams' prospect lists; we just prefer the ultra-young, up-the-middle guys in this system to a profile like Benson's, and Cleveland has lots of those.","_oDb1oLoVXU","sa917927"

Jake also missed most of his draft spring, but with a broken wrist. He returned not long before the draft and did not look very good, and teams had mixed opinions about him on draft day. Some thought he just needed more time to get back to full strength and speed, while others were scared off by their post-injury looks, which were so bad that multiple scouts told us they thought he may have been better off sitting out rather than giving teams a bad look just before the draft. 
At his best, McCarthy shows at least average raw power, plus speed, some feel to hit, and is a center field fit. His swing is naturally geared for opposite field contact, which will likely cap his power output unless he undergoes a swing change. That will be less necessary if McCarthy stays in center field.

At various points Hankins has utilized either a slider or curveball, and each looks good a few times a start but not often enough to project it as an impact pitch.

Dodson was Cal's two-hole hitter, starting center fielder, and closer. If forced to chose a traditional developmental path, teams would have overwhelmingly preferred Dodson on the mound, where his stuff is commensurate with a typical middle reliever. But Dodson is also a plus-running switch-hitter, with some natural lift as a right-handed hitter and good barrel control as a lefty. The Rays want to take advantage of all of Dodson's skills and asked that he be announced on draft day as a two-way player. At Cal, Dodson would often warm up his arm in center field, sometimes very little, before coming in to pitch in save situations. In pro ball, he pitched once every seven days, would have a bullpen day at the midpoint between outings, and either DH or play CF on the other days. Developing as a two-way player is actually less labor intensive than existing as one in college, where Dodson's schedule was more variable. Neither of Dodson's individual roles projects to be one of impact. On the mound he looks like a middle reliever; with the bat he looks like a fourth outfielder.

Indeed, Sanchez's ground ball percent dropped nine percentage points, but the changes compromised the quality of his contact in other ways, and made it hard for him to connect with pitches in some parts of the zone at all. His hands were stiff and loading late; they didn't seem as quick and twitchy as they had the previous year. These issues were exacerbated by Sanchez's already pull-heavy approach. 
Take solace in the fact that he is only 19 and doesn't turn 20 until April, and that his assignment to full season ball in 2018 was very aggressive. He also remains fast and quite good in center field. He looked much more like a fourth outfielder in 2018 than a table-setting center fielder, but there's lots of time to bounce back. ","","sa917767"

There's risk Hanifee is forced into the bullpen due to the lack of repertoire depth, but if his velo ticks up in max-effort, single-innings stints, he could be dominant.

Though both of Moss' swings are fairly inconsistent (which should be expected for a switch-hitter this age), he'll show you feel for both lift and contact at times, and he gets the most out of his little body without losing control of it. While there's a large developmental gap between where Moss is as a defender right now and where he'll need to be in order to stay on the infield, he's a very athletic, very young player with tons of time to improve those things, and his physical gifts are so prominent that we anticipate he will. Up the middle switch-hitters with some pop, even if it's just doubles power, are very valuable big leaguers, and not many prospects have a chance to become that kind of player.

The drop in his ground ball rate since coming over from LA -- 38% with Texas, after close to 50% with the Dodgers -- seems to corroborate the visual evidence of tweaks, so there's a chance Davis' 2018 was just the product of developmental growing pains. 
Even at 21, Davis remains physically projectable and is likely to add more and more mass and strength to his giant frame as he enters his mid-20s. The lift and rotation in his swing appear suited for power production that might arrive in games when new muscle arrives on the body. Davis doesn't track pitches well and he often appears imbalanced at the plate. We have him projected as a strikeout-prone third baseman who sells out for big power. He'll need to improve a bit on defense to stay on the infield, but it's unreasonable to expect most athletes this size to have total control of their bodies at this age anyway, so there's cause for optimism on that end.

He hit two full-extension, opposite field shots during the fall, including one that got out just left of center field at Sloan Park in Mesa. He’s patient and makes good decisions at the plate.

San Diego acquired him for fringe 40-man relief depth in the offseason. Quiroz presents rare 40-man flexibility because he's arguably ready to contribute to a big league lineup right now, but because of how recently he signed, he doesn't have to occupy a 40-man spot until the Padres need him on the active roster.

The first fastball was clocked by Rapsodo at 97 mph, and a few fastballs later, Guerra touched 100.4 mph. He has been working, an inning at a time, twice a week in Extended Spring Training. Eric saw him shortly before publication, and he was 95-98 with natural cut at times (in the linked video you can see how his fastball's spin axis is somewhat slidery) and had pretty impressive slider feel for someone who has only been pitching for a few weeks. He'll likely head out to an affiliate in the next week or so (probably Lake Elsinore). Guerra seems comfortable and confident on the mound, and he's going right at hitters with that fastball.

All of these components allow Bailey to strike out lots of batters without big velocity, but his approach to pitching is not conducive to efficient strike-throwing.

This year it was Young, who hit .285/.363/.445 with 50 extra-base hits and 44 steals for the Lugnuts. The travel ball circuit is not kind to economically disadvantaged families, and part of the reason Young was under-scouted as an amateur, as he told our own David Laurila, was because his family could not afford to attend heavily scouted showcases. 
Another reason he may have slid toward the end of the draft was because he was constantly moving around. He was under the international scouting umbrella while he was young and living in the Bahamas, then spent his early high school years in Florida before relocating to Georgia for his senior season. It's likely that three separate scouts in each org were responsible for scouting and gauging Young's signability. 
The Blue Jays got a deal done for $200,000 and Young has been a strong early-career performer. Pro scouts see him as a bit of a tweener but think there's a chance he might be an everyday center fielder if absolutely everything comes together. He's not a typical center field sprinter (our sources all have either a 50 or 55 on his speed) but he's instinctive, and fine there for now. If Young does move to a corner, his hit/power combination is on the fringe of profiling. A switch-hitter, Young has power from the right side of the plate but he's strikeout prone due to a lack of bat control. As a lefty, he has a gap-to-gap approach and good bat control, but not typical over-the-fence thump.

He made his stateside debut just before his 17th birthday and walked just six hitters in 50 innings all summer. So Santos has rare size, precocious velocity, and control, though much of the rest of the profile has room for improvement. He exhibits neither notable raw spin nor feel for locating his current breaking ball,  a low-80s slurve. There's a strong chance Santos tries several iterations of various breaking balls during the course of his development and the one(s) he ends up with will probably look much different than what he's currently using. At this point in his development, we just care about the raw spin, a trait of limited malleability, and Santos' is just okay. It's reasonable to hope he grows into elite velocity. The fact that he's throwing this hard at this age and at this size is encouraging, though he's less projectable than one would probably assume given his age and height. All talk of Santos' physical progression centers around reshaping his current frame rather than just adding mass, as he's already pretty filled out. This clouds the fastball projection somewhat, but he'll probably still end up throwing really hard. There's need for significant development throughout the rest of the repertoire, and it's more likely that a portion of that happens (resulting in a back-of-the rotation or bullpen role) than it is that all of it does (resulting in stardom).

Taylor was acquired from Arizona for Brad Boxberger, and after the Dbacks had taken his early-career development slowly (Taylor was a raw college arm from Canada), the Rays hit the gas pedal and quickly moved him to Montgomery in May. He thrived there, typically throwing 35 to 50 pitches once every three to five days. Most of those pitches are mid-90s fastballs that play up due to big extension, while some are above-average sliders. 
On paper, this reads like a standard two-pitch middle reliever, and for that reason, it's fair to question whether Taylor's usage might be caricaturing his velocity, and if his fastball would be this hard on back-to-back days, or if his usage would be more variable. But if this is just how Tampa Bay is going to use him, then this is the stuff. Taylor threw 78 innings in 38 games. His four starts were some of his shortest outings.

Garcia has the arm to profile in right field, but down the road, he'll likely be an average glove there at best. There's obvious leverage to his swing and he hit 10 homers in 44 games in the GCL as a 17-year-old, so it's not like he's sushi raw at tapping into his best tool. Dermis Garcia had similar tools at this stage, so that's one way this can go. Another would be former Tigers prospect Steven Moya, who played last year in Japan.

Tall, lanky, cold-weather arms often develop late; small-college players are typically a little behind large conference peers; and malleable athletes are  frequently able to make adjustments throughout their entire careers. Sharp is all of these. Originally from Michigan, he pitched at three colleges in three years (Eastern Michigan, Darton State College, and Drury University) in front of various groups of area scouts before he was drafted late in 2016. Sharp is also an ectomorphic 6-foot-4, and his limbs distract and also aid in his down-mound extension, enabling his fastball to sneak up on hitters more often than one would expect given its fringe velocity. Sharp learned the grip for his sinker, which has helped him generate a nearly 60% ground ball rate over the last two years, by seeing Blake Treinen's grip on the internet. Scouts have also noted that he has begun to vary the timing of his delivery to disorient hitters, à la Johnny Cueto. He's clearly still developing and doing so quickly. His stuff -- the sinker, a good changeup, average slider -- looks like that of a swing man or up/down arm, and most pitchers this age with this kind of stuff don't end up on our lists. But that stuff might play up because of extension and deception and continue to improve as Sharp's body and feel for his craft evolve. He may end up as a core member of a pitching staff rather than just a depth arm.","","sa738458"

At the very least, Cabrera projects as an outstanding multi-positional defender, but he also might just be plus at shortstop at maturity and need to play there every day. He also has advanced bat-to-ball skills and even though he has been physically overmatched for about 200 Low-A games over two seasons, he has somehow managed to maintain a strikeout rate in the low teens. Cabrera has a little, 5-foot-10 frame and it's not clear whether he'll grow into the kind of physicality that would make him a viable offensive player.

Even if his walk rate comes down, Rivas does enough other stuff to contribute to a big league roster. He won't hit homers, but he stings high-quality line drive contact to all-fields and can slash doubles down the third base line. He has sufficient speed and range for the middle infield, and has experience at every position but first base and catcher, though he hasn't played the outfield since 2015. Rivas' most realistic path to everyday production involves him retaining something close to his current walk rate, but he's more likely to become a valuable utility man who can play all over the field, and is a fairly high-probability prospect in that regard.","Tbf-2kCq_yI","sa872542"

Then German (Dominican-born and whose name is pronounced like the European country) had one of the latest pre-draft velo spikes possible, suddenly hitting 95 mph during the Atlantic Sun conference tournament in his final college game just two weeks before the draft. Velo is a dime a dozen these days, but German had the athleticism and arm action of a starter and had put on about 15 pounds in the previous 12 months, so some thought this could be coming. Clubs who had scouts at that start shot him up the board, and the Yankees jumped to the front of the line to take him in the fourth round. The velo spike held in pro ball: German sat 92-95 and hit 97 mph in fall instructional league and put on about 10 additional pounds after signing. The upside is a bit limited, as his slider and changeup still just flash average at best, but the Yankees are changing German's slurvy college breaking ball into more of a true slider and pushing him to throw his changeup more, so it wouldn't be shocking to see the future pitch grades move north as he continues to mature as a pitcher.","","sa3007729"

Once in possession of ugly bat control that enabled him to put lots of balls in play but not with any real impact, Hermosillo's most recent swing adjustment has him trading some of that contact for power. As Hermosillo's leg kick grew bigger and slower, his ground ball rate shrunk.

Though he didn't perform during a 30-game big league look, Hermosillo's athleticism and ability to make adjustments bode well for his future. His baseball instincts aren't great, but he has some pop that he's started to get to, he can fly, and he may get lots of playing time due to the Angels' fairly thin outfield situation.

It's a cliche in scouting to call a player a 'Venezuelan-style shortstop,' but Soto fits that to a T: smaller, without big tools, but with an advanced feel to play, and a gritty, high-effort style. He had about 30-grade raw power when he signed, and his exit velos were topping out in the mid-90s in the GCL for Atlanta, but he's now hitting a quarter of his balls in play in the 90s and looks like he'll be able to avoid being so weak that pitchers can knock the bat out of his hands. Soto is a roughly average runner with a roughly average arm, but both tools play up due to his instincts and strong internal clock, so he's a potential above average shortstop. He also has advanced feel to hit, with above average bat control and a self-aware approach at the plate.

This does not appear to have been the case with King, who was a prospect afterthought when he was part of a seemingly innocuous trade between the Marlins and Yankees just after the 2017 season. King had been a Marlins 12th round pick out of Boston College a year and a half prior to the deal and, like clockwork, had only struck out about six batters per nine innings every year in college, as well as in his first two pro seasons. The Marlins altered King's position on the rubber and made other mechanical tweaks to alter the movement profile of his pitches. After the Yankees acquired him, they let him return to what he was doing in college and he vastly exceeded even the most optimistic expectations in 2018. He led the Yankees system in strikeouts and innings while traversing three levels, reaching Triple-A. 
The lynchpin of King's success is his command of a dancing two-seam fastball that runs back onto his glove-side corner of the plate. Left-handed hitters think it's coming at their hip, righties give up on it because they think it's off the plate, and King gets a lot of looking strikeouts with it. There are questions about the quality of his secondary stuff. He has a quality changeup, but his breaking ball is mediocre. He seems to have added a cutter late in the year, and that pitch's movement may better complement that of his fastball. Most teams have King evaluated as a stable backend starter; some think he should be in the 45 FV tier of this list. A purported nerd and exhaustive pre-start preparer, King is a high-probability big leaguer who we believe has limited ceiling, though if he develops 7 or 8 command, all bets are off.","","19853"

Hernandez was academically ineligible as a sophomore and only started 19 games in three years of college, so there's at least a reason he's behind his peers from a developmental standpoint.

In retrospect that looks a little silly, as the 2015 class included Vladimir Guerrero, Jr., Juan Soto, Fernando Tatis, Jr., Cristian Pache, and Andres Gimenez, but that opinion was the consensus amongst many top evaluators; those five superior prospects all received lower bonuses than Maitan for a reason. 
Maitan signed with Atlanta as the clear top prospect in his class, and the clear top prospect to emerge in many years. Then things took a turn for him as a pro. Maitan added some natural strength and bulk soon after signing (which many scouts anticipated, projecting him to a corner), then started adding some bad weight, lost his swing mechanics, and started tinkering. Things snowballed from there, ending in a disappointing debut season with Atlanta. After that season, the Braves international scandal hit, and Maitan became a free agent. He kept his original $4.25 million bonus (widely reported to have been topped by multiple clubs late in the process, though he and his family chose to honor their word to Atlanta) and hit the open market, where he received $2.2 million amid some scouts' suggestions that he wasn't even the best of the Braves' prospects to be cut loose. 
The same issues continued with Los Angeles in 2018, and Maitan had another disappointing season, with a worrisome physique and an evolving swing. The raw tools that originally got scouts interested -- raw power you can project to a 70, a 65-grade arm, infield hands, feel to hit -- still appear to be in there and Angels sources indicate Maitan spent the offseason getting in better shape, a process they anticipated would be slow from the onset, hopefully foreshadowing a breakout year. The organization is excited about what could happen in 2019, with Maitan as part of an exciting Low-A Burlington club that should include him, Jeremiah Jackson, and Livan Soto in the infield and Jordyn Adams, D'Shawn Knowles, and Trent Deveaux in the outfield.

His breaking ball has bat-missing vertical action and is hard for hitters to differentiate out of Bradish's hand, in part because his delivery causes the ball to suddenly appear out from behind his head, which some hitters struggle to adjust to.

An excellent on-mound athlete with advanced command, Jefferies was 91-93 the summer after he signed, then 92-95 with a reshaped array of secondary offerings the following spring. He looked likely to be a quick-mover, someone who might reach Double-A in his first full season. Alas, his UCL did not cooperate and Jefferies had Tommy John a week after James Kaprielian did. Jefferies returned during 2018 extended spring training and his velocity had totally returned.

Healthy Jefferies has surgical command of a low-90s heater and plus power changeup. So firm is Jefferies' cambio that TrackMan units often mistakenly classify it as a sinker as it resides in the mid-to-upper 80s. It bottoms out late and hard, and is Jefferies' best secondary pitch.

Jeremy was a solid prep prospect, but not the type who gets a big bonus and signs out of high school, so he ended up at Missouri State and had a breakout sophomore year. He was often seen by high-level decision makers during that breakout because he was playing alongside first round third baseman Jake Burger, and he had 2018 first round buzz by the end of the college postseason because scouts thought he could be a passable shortstop with all-fields power, and analytics folks liked his huge sophomore season and higher-than-you'd-expect exit velos. 
Then Eierman had an inconsistent summer with Team USA and his draft spring was a bit of a letdown. He plateaued, arguably had a worse statistical season, and suddenly there were doubts about his approach and ultimate defensive home. He fell to Oakland at 70th overall last summer. Oakland has been a bit more open to non-traditional fits at shortstop recently and they clearly think that with more reps there, Eierman can stick.

His speed enables viability in center, but he's just okay out there, and it's not enough to override the offensive issues and enable an everyday role. He projects as a high-end pinch runner and corner outfield defensive replacement, but there's a chance he ends up as the larger half of a center field platoon.","xHm8T-1ZJIw","sa736690"

He spent the rest of the year finishing rehab and working on a changeup in the bullpen. 
Back in games this spring, Grove has been 93-95, up to 96.6, with a 12:30 spin axis, which teams like LA and Houston seem to prefer, as 12:30 is almost pure backspin, a component of fastball rise. Grove has two different breaking balls, a low-80s curveball and an upper-80s slider, but it's clear changeup development is the priority right now. The Dodgers sent Grove straight to Hi-A and it appears he'll be on an innings limit and throw shorter outings so he can pitch all year rather than go six or seven innings at a shot and be shut down sometime during the summer. He's well-built, athletic, throws hard, and has good measurable spin, and the Dodgers have a pretty good track record of developing arms, including several with college injuries. Though scouts we spoke with who saw Grove this spring thought he lacked feel, that could be chalked up to rust, and we like Grove as a riser.","","sa3008625"

Additional evidence that this uptick in power is real is the change in Sosa'a ground ball rate, which has dropped from 50% in '16 and '17 to 38% in '18. Because he's such a free-swinger, Sosa will probably run pretty low OBPs as a big leaguer, but he has barrell control and his hands have life, so he's going to hit some.

He will likely need to move to first base, perhaps even while he's still in the minors, putting a ton of pressure on his admittedly prodigious bat to fully actualize. There's not much physical projection here, so the raw power Nuñez currently has is pretty close to what he'll have at peak, meaning the bat-to-ball component is what will drive his stock going forward."," ","sa3008113"

As he reached the upper levels, that swing became untenable and needed to change. It did in 2017, when Williams opened his stance, utilized a big leg kick instead of an odd, double toe tap and began to lift the ball more. His ground ball rate dropped from 60% to 52% (which is still high) and he had a monster 2017 before regressing in 2018. Williams doesn't close all the way when he strides and he's become very pull-heavy and easier to pitch to. Other than the power, the rest of Williams' toolset is pretty generic, so he's going to have to hit a ton to profile. St. Louis has had success tweaking the swings of similar players in the past and Williams' groundball rate dropped to 42% after the Cardinals acquired him in the Tommy Pham trade, though that was only in a 76 PA sample. There's also an approach issue here as Williams really likes to swing. With Williams' power and pedigree, we'll continue to monitor him in case anything changes or improves, and if it does he could be a valuable role-playing corner outfielder.

On the one hand, he's a switch-hitting middle infielder who has made lots of contact -- Leyba is a .285 career hitter -- over six pro seasons. On the other, he has been hurt a lot -- shoulder surgery, most recently -- and may be painted into too small a defensive corner to be rosterable if he doesn't hit enough to be a regular. It's important to be mindful of prospect fatigue creeping in here, as Leyba really broke out during the summer of 2014 when as a teenager, he hit a combined .323 in the Penn and Midwest Leagues. He was sent to Arizona as part of the three-way, Didi Gregorius-headlined trade that offseason, had a bad 2015 in the Cal League, bounced back in 2016, and has basically been hurt since. 
Because of Leyba's size and lack of power, he has to keep making high-end rates of contact to profile as an everyday player. If he lacks sufficient arm strength for shortstop coming out of the shoulder surgery, it puts even more pressure on the hit tool, because a bench role is less feasible for someone without defensive versatility.","OYwgNhVUC4w","16404"

Though he does most of his damage on pitches on the inner half, Young has enough barrel control to spoil pitches away from him until he gets something he can square up. When Young connects, he does so with power. Buff and square-shouldered, Young's physicality is a driving component of his power but it's also why he's somewhat limited defensively. Young has seen time at shortstop, third base, and left field as a pro but was mostly kept at second base in 2018.

Johnson's special bat speed and ability to rotate are both evident to the naked eye, and he also has remarkable bat control for a player who takes such high-effort swings. But everything about his game is very raw and he'll likely require years of polish before he's ready for the majors. This is especially evident in his footwork in the box, where Johnson's stride length and direction are both highly variable. At times, this enables Johnson to turn on pitches on the inner half; at others it wrecks his swing's balance and composition entirely. There's also a wide range of potential defensive outcomes for Johnson. He may end up on the middle infield or in center, depending on how his body and infield actions develop, or possibly in an outfield corner. The good news is that Johnson was one of the youngest players available in the 2018 draft and he didn't turn 18 the middle of October. There's a lot of time for both him and the Marlins to figure this stuff out, and he has some unteachable talents (the bat speed and bat control) that could drive an offensive profile befitting any position if he transforms into a hitter instead of a swinger.","V3s25q8PgR0","sa3008110"

The Marlins took the same route with Rogers as they had the year before with Braxton Garrett; Rogers didn't throw a single pro pitch in his draft year and instead was sent to Low-A the following May after a few weeks in extended. By that time, Rogers was already 20. He struck out a lot of hitters at Greensboro but was also relatively hittable, and pro scouts have the same issue with his breaking ball as some on the amateur side of the industry did, though it plays okay against lefties because of his lower arm slot. We think the changeup will eventually be Rogers' best pitch and it might have to be since right-handed hitters get a nice, long look at the fastballs coming out of his hand.

The pair signed for $6.25 million, $5.25 million of which went to 22-year-old Victor Victor. Mesa began playing in Cuba's Series Nacional when he was 16. He had a breakout '16-'17 at age 20 and swiped 40 bags while slashing .354/.399/.539. He was seen stateside the following summer during Cuba's tour of the CanAm League, but didn't play well. After he defected, teams' only looks at Mesa were in a workout setting. Cuban prospects have sometimes undergone drastic physical transformations between the point at which they’ve last been observed in Cuba and their workouts for teams. Sometimes these changes are positive, as with Luis Robert, who looked like an Ancient Greek sculpture when he worked out for teams in the Dominican Republic in 2017. Sometimes they are not; Yasiel Puig’s living conditions made it impossible for him to remain in baseball shape for his eventual workout in Mexico. But this was not the case with Mesa, who retained the sort of physicality he possessed during his last several years in Cuba. He ran a plus-plus 60-yard dash time, threw well, and hit some balls out to his pull side during batting practice. Mesa has a linear, contact-oriented swing that we think will lead to below-average power output in games. He can hit, defend, and add value on the bases, but there’s real doubt about the game application of his power. In aggregate, it looks like an average to slightly below-average offensive profile on an above-average defender at a premium position, which amounts to a low-risk, moderate impact prospect who should be ready for the big leagues relatively soon. He garners frequent comparisons to Cubs CF Albert Almora.","K7KQgt1ZsuU","sa3008602"

There's still a long way to go, but currently Castillo has rare arm strength, good athleticism, and a good delivery without much else.

If he develops velocity, Santos could be very good very quickly because he can do everything else. He has a plus-flashing split-action changeup and can locate an average slider. His fastball moves, and he can run it back onto his gloveside corner or just off the plate to his arm side. But it's hard to say if Santos will grow into more fastball because his frame is already maxed out. The scouting reports of rising high school seniors Jesus Luzardo and Forrest Whitley read an awful lot like that before each of them altered their training and conditioning, and experienced a huge jump in velocity. Whether Santos is a candidate for 'reverse projection' in this way is hard to say, but it's fair to assume some growth on the fastball through sheer physical maturity. If Santos retains his command at greater velocities, he's going to move quickly and could be a monster.

It turned out the Rays were that team, and Mercado signed for $2.1 million, about $400,000 over slot, as a second rounder. After a year and a half of pro ball, Mercado's stuff is basically the same. His fastball resides in the low-90s and he'll show you an above-average curveball and changeup once in a while.

When Erceg is going at the plate, he's dropping the bat head and golfing out pitches down and in, or flaying pitches away from him down the third base line for a double.

That nearly unprecedented velocity for his age obviously garnered a lot of attention in the scouting community, though he was, as you'd guess, still very raw and often had 20 control when he was scraping triple digits. Gaston also isn't classically projectable in that his velocity is already at the top of the scale and he has a maturely-built frame at 6-foot, but he did some arm slot and arm action tinkering over the last few years that has affected his control and command. So while Gaston may get stronger as he physically matures, what's more important is the projection of his feel for pitching, which appears to be more natural at a three-quarters arm slot (more mid-90s velocity), where his arm action is also more naturally online than the higher slot where he was throwing harder and wilder. Gaston's best pitching performance was as the main event on the mound at the Victor Victor Mesa workout in Marlins Park where the better version of his arm slot, arm action, and control was first seen by a large scouting audience. His best off-speed pitch is a solid average curveball and he also has a changeup that flashes average, so the full stuff package, beyond just the fastball, is also top of the scale elite, but Gaston is also hard to project given the varied looks he's given scouts over the last year.","PB7HrCsfEUU","sa3011136"

Iglesias was a better defender than Alcantara (and, well, just about everybody) and had better feel for contact with similar power, and is someone we'd ideally have as a 45 or 50 on prospect lists based on his' WAR production. Logically, Alcantara needs to be beneath those tiers. He could be a speedy, versatile bench infielder for a long time, though.","","sa739641"

His hitting hands are explosive but still pretty uncoordinated, especially from the left side of the plate.

The Tigers made him the top pick on Day 2 of the 2018 draft and he finished the year with a strong month and a half at Low-A, often against pitching worse than what he faced in college. 
He has a very pretty left-handed swing and can move the bat head around the zone, but Clemens doesn't always track or diagnose pitches well. He may be a swing-and-miss risk against better pro pitching, but what he does may still be enough at second base, assuming Clemens can stay there. At best, teams think he'll be an inoffensive second baseman, with some projecting Clemens to third base or an outfield corner. One source compared him to current 50 FV prospect Shed Long.

The Braves drafted him in the second compensation round for an overslot bonus, using the pick they bought from Baltimore in exchange for Brian Matusz's contract. Eventually, and ironically, Atlanta traded him to Baltimore as part of the multi-player return for Kevin Gausman and Darren' O'Day's contract. Since signing, Cumberland's defense and pop times have improved, due in part to a slimmed-down physique and in part to improved throwing mechanics that make the most of his average arm strength. We think he'll be able to catch part time and also have enough of a bat to contribute at first base, DH, or as a pinch hitter. He's moved down a bit for us since last season as his strong start and improved defense early in 2018 tailed off a bit later in the season, which is somewhat common for players who are dealing with physical change during the longest full-time catching spell of their lives. Some scouts questioned Cumberland's bat control and thus his hit tool and game power in late 2018 looks, so looks early in 2019 may tell us if this was a slight regression in tools, or just temporary fatigue he can get past.

Lange's changeup usage increased dramatically in 2018 and the pitch improved. His curevball doesn't have big raw spin but it's still really effective and remains his best pitch. His delivery is deceptive and enables his fastball to play despite below-average velocity. It appears there's a starter's arsenal here and Lange threw plenty of strikes in 2018.

By that fall's instructional league, the Braves realized they had a prospect on their hands and acted accordingly, pushing Encarnacion to Low-A at age 20 where he put up a 118 wRC+ as an age-appropriate prospect in a full-season league, just two years after he signed for almost nothing. The change was simple: Encarnacion's projection and actions turned into tools with physical development. He now shows 60 raw power in BP, above average arm strength and bat control, and average speed. Encarnacion still has some skills that require growth, as his plate approach is too aggressive to work at the upper levels. And while he has the physical tools to play third base, he's error-prone. The raw tool package and quick-developing statistical performance are a rare combo, so Encarnacion and Cumberland headlined the Orioles' return in the Kevin Gausman trade with Atlanta last summer. It's not a stretch to say Encarnacion has the best tools of any Latin prospect in the Orioles' lower minors, but that's mostly because the Orioles have had a near non-existent international program and their three best international signees (Yusniel Diaz, Encarnacion, Jean Carmona) were all acquired last summer.","Uc8c7Vwd82E","sa921562"

He clearly had substantial raw power, but never slugged more than his freshman year mark of .437 at Nebraska. Since college, Boldt's swing has evolved in a way that better incorporates his lower half. It has more scoop, more ability to catch pitches in, and he's better able to lift balls that are down. Supporting evidence can be found by observing Boldt's batted ball profile, as his groundball rate is now close to league average instead of well above it. Though he thickened quickly in college, Boldt is still an above-average runner once he gets underway. His slow first few steps prevent him from everyday viability in center field, and Boldt saw more time in the outfield corners last year than at any other time during his career. He projects as a platoon corner outfielder, especially if last year's swing changes were just the start of a continuous, upward trend in power output.","","sa738262"

He had flashy actions at shortstop, above-average bat speed, and he made hard contact through the 2017 fall instructional league despite a long, somewhat stiff swing. When Carmona arrived in Arizona the following spring, he had filled out quite a bit, and his already middling lateral range became a larger issue. He suddenly seemed more likely to end up at third base, though he could potentially be very good there. The Brewers pushed Carmona to the Pioneer League during the summer. He struggled there, and continued to after he was traded to Baltimore in the Jonathan Schoop deal. The bat is very much a work in progress and Carmona is a risk to trend down the defensive spectrum, but he has the physical talent to be an above-average defensive third baseman with some pop if all of his issues are remedied.","4i402sfEdFA","sa3003340"

But that's Baltimore's back yard, and the Orioles were able to draft and sign him for $125,000. Pro scouts were intrigued by what they saw from Zebron in the fall, who was up to 93 during instructs. He's loose, semi-projectable, and can spin a breaking ball (his curveball averages 2750 rpm, so Trackman-influenced teams are probably interested, too) but is also very raw for a 19-year-old, and he may need to spend 2019 repeating the GCL.
