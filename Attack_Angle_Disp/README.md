# Attack Angle Display
This is an app for tracking Attack Angle and other hitting metrics in the 2019 and 2020 seasons (will be updated throughout 2021).  As of now I'm just going to keep updating the scripts I use to generate the data on the app.  All data is pulled from BaseballSavant/Statcast and is highly accessible but I do not want to keep updating and pushing the latest raw data.  I'll instead leave a last updated date in the app.
